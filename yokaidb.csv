https://yokai.com/kappa/,Kappa,河童,かっぱ,river child,"kawatarō, kawako","rivers, lakes, ponds, waterways, cisterns, wells; found throughout Japan",omnivorous; prefers cucumbers and human entrails,"Kappa are aquatic, reptilian humanoids who inhabit the rivers and streams flowing over Japan. Clumsy on land, they are at home in the water, and thrive during the warm months. Kappa are generally the size and shape of a human child, yet despite their small stature they are physically stronger than a grown man. Their scaly skin ranges from a deep, earthy green to bright reds and even blue. Kappa bodies are built for swimming; they have webbed, thumbless hands and feet, a turtle-like beak and shell, and an elastic, waterproof skin that reeks of fish and is said to be removable. Other inhuman traits include three anuses that allow them to pass three times as much gas as humans, and forearms attached to one another inside of their shells—pulling on one arm lengthens it while the other arm contracts. But their most distinguishing characteristic is a dish-like depression that lies on top of their skulls. This dish is the source of a kappa’s power and must be kept filled with water at all times. Should the water be spilled and the dish dry up, the kappa will be unable to move. It may even die.","While younger kappa are frequently found in family groups, adult kappa live solitary lives. However, it is common for kappa to befriend other yōkai and sometimes even people. Possessed of a keen intelligence, kappa are one of the few yōkai able to learn human languages. They are highly knowledgeable about medicine and the art of setting bones. According to legend, friendly kappa taught these skills to humans. For fun, they love causing mischief, practicing martial arts like sumo wrestling, and playing games of skill like shogi. Kappa are proud and stubborn, but also fiercely honorable; they never break a promise. Kappa will eat almost anything, but they are particularly fond of two foods: cucumbers and raw innards—particularly human anuses.","Kappa are revered in Shinto as a kind of water god. It is not uncommon to see offerings of cucumbers made at riverbanks by devout humans. In return, kappa help people by irrigating fields, befriending lonely children, or competing with adults in sports and games.","Kappa can also be crass and dangerous. Lakes and rivers where they live are often marked with warning signs. Kappa particularly despise cows and horses, and will attack the animals for no reason at all. Mischievous by nature, they loudly pass gas in public and love to peek up women’s kimonos. Sometimes their mischief turns violent. Kappa have been known to kidnap or rape swimming women, and kill people. A kappa’s preferred method of attack is to drown its victims, or bite them to death under water. Kappa also devour humans alive. Usually they go for the rear end to get at the shirikodama, a mythical ball of flesh located just inside the anus.
In the water, there is no escape for anyone who crosses a kappa. On land, however, it is possible to outwit one; the honorable kappa will feel obliged to return a bow. If it can be tricked into bowing so low that the water in its dish spills out, it can be overcome. Once bested, kappa have been made to swear loyalty and friendship to their victor for the rest of their lives.",,,,
https://yokai.com/garappa/,Garappa,ガラッパ,がらっぱ,a regional corruption of kappa,gawappa,"rivers, lakes, ponds, streams; found only on Kyūshū",omnivorous; same as the kappa,"Garappa are river spirits found on the islands of Kyūshū in southern Japan. Close relatives of kappa, they resemble them in many ways. The two are often confused with each other, although there are a number of important differences. A garappa’s limbs are much longer than those of a kappa. When garappa sit down their knees rise high above their heads, unlike the stubby kappa’s knees. Because of these longer limbs, garappa are taller than kappa when standing upright. Garappa also have slightly longer and more streamlined faces.","Garappa are shyer and more elusive than kappa. They tend to avoid populated areas and instead, wander back and forth between the rivers and mountains. Garappa live in smaller groups, or by themselves. Because of their shyness, garappa are more often heard than seen. They have two distinctive calls: “hyō hyō” and, “foon foon foon.”","While garappa encounters are much rarer than kappa, they share a similar relationship with humankind. Extremely fond of pranks and mischief, garappa love to surprise people on mountain paths, or trick travelers into losing their way. Like kappa, garappa are physically stronger than humans and are easily capable of overpowering grown men larger than themselves. They are extremely fond of sumo wrestling, at which they are highly skilled. Garappa are also sexually aggressive and are known to assault and rape women.","Despite their reputation as tricksters, garappa are absolutely dedicated to keeping their word. When captured or bested in contest by humans, they can be forced by their victors to promise to stop drowning people, playing pranks, making noises in the woods, or similar concessions. Over the centuries, Shinto sects who revere garappa have worked to earn promises from them to cease doing evil. As a result garappa attacks have become less and less common over time. Garappa occasionally even serve humans by catching fish or planting rice fields, and they are credited with teaching the ancient people of Kyūshū the art of making poultices.",,,,

Cousins of kappa and garappa, they are more savage and belligerent. Physically they are short, with bald scalps, sharp claws, and a mouth full of sharp teeth which are prominently visible due to the malicious smile they wear. Their skins are covered with a pelt of thick, greasy hair that gathers dust, oil, and dirt. This repulsive pelt constantly sheds wherever they go. Their name is said to come from the “hyo hyo” call that they make. However, written in kanji, the characters have a martial connotation.","Hyōsube live near rivers, where they catch wild fish and generally keep away from humans. Their favorite food is eggplant—they are capable of devouring whole patches in the blink of an eye. Like kappa, hyōsube love mischief and hate horses. They are generally more violent and malicious than their cousins, but they retain a strong sense of honor.","Hyōsube are capricious, insolent, and extremely dangerous. Simply looking at a hyōsube can cause a terrible and contagious fever, which can spread and turn into an epidemic. Hyōsube cackle with an evil laughter which is also contagious; an unlucky person who hears a hyōsube laugh, and who laughs himself, will be struck with fever and die within hours.","A hyōsube’s thick hair builds up with dirt and grime; they love nothing more than to sneak into houses at night and slip into the bathtub. When a hyōsube finds a bathtub it likes it often returns every night, leaving behind a thick scum of greasy body hair and a horrible stench. Once, the unlucky owner of such a house emptied the bathwater and threw out the hair and grease. This angered the hyōsube so much that it slaughtered the owner’s horse the next night. When another unfortunate dumped his bathtub and some hyōsube hairs accidentally landed on a nearby horse, the animal promptly dropped dead. In yet another tale, a woman spied on a hyōsube ravaging her eggplant garden; the next morning her entire body had turned purple. She died soon after.
Hyōsube are occasionally honored at local Shinto shrines, usually worshiped as gods of war for some military service performed for villagers in the past. Farmers living in areas inhabited by hyōsube often leave offerings of the first eggplants of the harvest in hopes that the hyōsube will spare their fields for the remainder of the year. Those who do not leave offerings can find their fields trampled.",,,,

It is a regal animal, holy and highly revered. The kirin is often considered a god in its own right. Resembling a deer with scales like a dragon’s covering its body, the kirin is a chimerical beast. It has a tail like an ox and a flowing mane. Its body and mane are covered in brilliant, holy fire and its face is the picture of utter serenity.","A gentle animal, the kirin never eats the flesh of other beings, and takes great care never to tread on any living thing, even insects. When it walks, it does so without trampling a single blade of grass. Its beauty is only surpassed by its rarity; the unicorn-like kirin only appears during periods of world peace. They are seen only in lands owned by wise and benevolent people and during the reigns of noble and enlightened rulers, where they herald a golden age. Although kirin never harm good and pure souls, they are swift and fierce to attack if threatened, breathing holy fire from their mouths.","Because kirin are beasts of purity and goodness, they have been used in carvings and paintings as symbols of these virtues since early times. They are also seen as symbols of justice and wisdom. Because of their holiness, images of kirin frequently adorn temples and shrines. Omens of great luck and fortune, the appearance of a kirin is believed to be a sign of the arrival of a great leader or a wise man.","Giraffes are also called kirin in Japanese, named for the traits they share with the holy kirin. Their long legs, scale-like pattern, gentle nature, and the knobs on their heads must have reminded the first Japanese to see a giraffe of this most sacred of beasts.","Kirin were introduced to Japan via Chinese myths and legends where they are known as qilin. Over time, the Chinese and Japanese version diverged into slightly different creatures. In Japan, the kirin is considered to be the most powerful and sacred beast of all, surpassing the hōō and tatsu.",,,

They are described as having the beak of a rooster, the jaw of a swallow, the head of a pheasant, the neck of a snake, the back of a tortoise, the legs of a crane, and the tail of a peacock. Brilliantly colored with the five colors of the Chinese elements—white, black, red, yellow, and blue—they have five distinctive tail feathers.","Hōō are creatures of utter peace and never cause harm to other living things. They eat only bamboo seeds, and nest only in paulownia trees. When a hōō flies, it is said that the wind stops, dust settles, and birds and insects grow quiet. Because of their purity, they appear only in lands blessed with peace, prosperity, and happiness. They flee to the heavens during times of trouble. The appearance of a hōō is an extremely good omen, said to signify the beginning of a new era.","The hōō is a popular motif in Japanese paintings, crafts, kimonos, and as designs on temples and shrines. As a symbol, it represents fire, the sun, and the imperial family. It also stands for the virtues of duty, propriety, faith, and mercy. Its five colors represent the five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.","The hōō is one of the most revered and holiest animals in Japan. Second only to the kirin in terms of power, it is the most sacred bird in the Japanese pantheon.","Hōō come from Chinese mythology, where they are known as fenghuang. Originally they were considered to be two distinct birds: the male hō (feng) and the female ō (huang), symbolizing yin and yang and the duality of the universe. Eventually the two creatures merged into one and their combined name was used. The combined creature is still considered to be female, and is often partnered with the tatsu, which is considered to be male.",,,

They have long, scaled bodies, serpentine tails, sharp teeth and claws, and often have horns, antlers, spines, and beards. Some tatsu have multiple limbs or heads. Many disguise themselves as humans and are never seen in their natural forms.","Tatsu are strongly connected to water—be it rain, rivers, seas, or oceans—and are considered to be water gods. They live in splendid palaces at the bottom of deep seas, or in other secluded places. They usually live far from human-inhabited areas, but occasionally make their homes near Buddhist temples. Like Western dragons, they hoard vast amounts of treasure and keep powerful magical artifacts in their homes. Many are great villains, tormenting mankind out of spite, while others are pure and kind, offering their wisdom and power to those seeking it. Some tatsu even allow worthy heroes to visit them, and lend their magical items to noble warriors.","Tatsu rarely concern themselves with human affairs unless it affects them directly. They accept worship and sacrifices from humans; many temples maintain the holy grounds of local dragons, and countless Japanese make pilgrimages to holy mountains inhabited by tatsu. Tatsu receive prayers for rain or for protection from floods, and other water-related requests. Fireworks festivals, ritual dragon dances, and other local celebrations honor these dragon gods all over the Japanese islands.",,"Tatsu are one of the oldest supernatural creatures known in Japan. The first recorded stories go back to the earliest written accounts of Japanese history and mythology, the Kojiki and the Nihongi. Over the centuries, tales of the Chinese long and Indian naga were incorporated into Japanese mythology. Today’s Japanese dragons are an amalgamation of these imported myths merged with the indigenous water deities of prehistoric Japan.","The Japanese imperial family, the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world, is supposedly descended from dragons (as well as other gods). The monarchy is said to have been founded in 660 BCE by Emperor Jimmu, the legendary first ruler of Japan. His father was the son of Toyotama hime, who in turn was the daughter of Ryūjin, the dragon god of the sea. So by tradition the emperor of Japan is the direct descendant of a dragon.",,

Despite their monstrous appearance, baku are revered as powerful forces of good and as one of the holy protectors of mankind.","Baku watch over humans and act as guardian spirits. They feed on the dreams of humans—specifically bad dreams. Evil spirits and yōkai fear baku and flee from baku-inhabited areas. Because of this, health and good luck follow baku wherever they go.","The baku’s written name and image have been used as symbols of good luck in talismans and charms throughout Japanese history. In the old days, it was common to embroider the kanji for baku onto pillows in order to keep away bad dreams, sickness, and evil spirits. Fearsome baku images are commonly carved into the pillars above temple doors and on the columns supporting temple roofs. Baku are one of only a handful of holy creatures honored in this manner.","Today, the Japanese word baku also refers to the tapir. The animal was named for its uncanny resemblance to this holy chimerical beast.","Legend has it that when the world was new and the gods were making the animals, the baku was put together from the leftover bits and pieces at the end of creation. That explains its bizarre appearance, and why it is considered a favorite of the gods.",,,

They can range in size from a small dog to the size of a lion and—due to their resemblance to both creatures—are often called lion dogs in English. They have thick, curly manes and tails, powerful, muscular bodies, and sharp teeth and claws. Some koma inu have large horns like a unicorn on their heads. However, many are hornless.","Koma inu are fierce and noble beasts. They act like watchdogs, guarding gates and doorways and preventing the wicked from entering. They live together in male-female pairs and are always found together. In their pairs, the female usually guards those living inside, while the male guards the structure itself.","Koma inu are a ubiquitous symbol at holy sites in Japan. Stone koma inu statues are almost always found at the entrance to Shinto shrines, often with more inside the shrine guarding the important buildings. The pairs are usually carved in two poses: one with mouth open in a roaring position, and one with mouth closed. Symbolically, these creatures represent yin and yang, or death and life. The open-mouthed koma inu represents the sound “a,” while the closed-mouthed koma inu represents the sound “un.” These sounds are the Japanese transliteration of the Sanskrit “om,” a mystical syllable which symbolizes the beginning, middle, and end of all things. A Western analogy would be alpha and omega.",,"Koma inu were brought to Japan via Korea, which in turn received them from China, which in turn received them from India. China is where they first began to symbolize the Dharmic philosophies of Indian religions. In China these dogs are called shishi, which means “stone lion.” This name is often used in Japan as well, though it only refers to the one with its mouth open.

Short, fat creatures shaped like mallets, Nozuchi are about fifteen centimeters in diameter and just over one meter long. They have no eyes, nose, or any other facial features save for a large mouth located on the tops of their heads, pointing towards the sky. Their bodies are covered in a bristly fur, much like a hairy caterpillar.","Nozuchi make their homes inside of large trees, particularly on the tops of hills. They are slow movers, and get about by rolling and tumbling down slopes, then slowly inching their way back up. Their usual diet is wildlife—mice, rabbits, squirrels, and other small animals—however, they are able to eat things much larger than themselves. In Nara, they are known to feed on deer. They can devour a deer in a single bite, pulling the whole animal into their small, stumpy frame.","Nozuchi have been known to attack humans who come near their nests, rolling downhill and snapping at their feet. Their bites are dangerous, resulting in terrible, mangled wounds which quickly lead to a high fever and death. A person who is touched or even merely seen by a tumbling nozuchi can contract this fever and die. Fortunately, nozuchi attacks are easily avoided. Stick to higher ground where they cannot tumble, or climb a tree if no other high ground is available.",,,,"Nozuchi can transform into a humanoid shape, though they rarely are seen in this form. They take the shape of a human priest, but with no eyes, nose, hair, or ears. The only feature on the head is a large, gaping mouth pointing upwards towards the sky. Wicked monks who are banished from their temples to live in the wilds sometimes gradually turn into nozuchi. These nozuchi are more likely to maintain a humanoid form than a serpentine one.

The orbs can range in size from three to thirty centimeters, and usually float around at eye-level. They appear in places surrounded by nature—most often during the spring and summer months, and particularly on rainy days.",,"Onibi do not create much heat, but the orbs possess a different danger. Living creatures that draw too close are swarmed by dozens of orbs, which drain away the life force from their victims. Soon nothing is left but a dead husk on the ground. During the night, onibi are often mistaken for distant lanterns, and people have vanished into the forests chasing after these phantom lights. Travelers should take care not to be lead off their paths to their deaths by demon fire.","Onibi are found all over Japan. In some areas, they manifest the faces and even voices of the victims whose life force they have drained. In Okinawa, onibi are said to take the shape of a small bird.",Onibi are born out of the dead bodies of humans and animals.

One of these is the kijimunā: an elfin creature that makes it home in the banyan trees that grow all over the Ryukyu archipelago. Physically, kijimunā are about the same height as a child, with wild and thick bright red hair, and red tinted skin. They wear skirts made of grass, and move about by hopping rather than walking. Although kijimunā retain the appearance of child-like youthfulness into their adulthood, males are noted for their large and prominent testicles.","The kijimunā lifestyle mimics humans in many ways. They fish along the shores, live in family units, get married, and raise children in much the same way as the native islanders. On rare occasions, they marry into human families. The kijimunā diet consists entirely of seafood. They are excellent fishers, and are particularly skilled at diving. Kijimunā use both these skills to catch their favorite dish: fish heads—specifically the head of the snapper species called the double-lined fusilier. They are especially fond of fish eyes, even preferring the left eye over the right. Okinawans attribute eyeless corpses of fish found on the beach to picky kijimunā.","Kijimunā often help fishermen catch fish, or aid humans in other ways in return for a cooked meal. When they form friendships with humans, it can last for a lifetime. Kijimunā will often return to their human friends many times, even spending holidays with their adopted family.","Kijimunā have a number of peculiar fears and prejudices. They loathe chickens and cooking pots. They are extremely put off by people passing gas. However, the thing they hate above all else is the octopus. They avoid octopuses at all costs, despising them and fearing them at the same time.
Unprovoked kijimunā attacks on humans are rare. Cutting down the banyan tree in which they live is a sure way to earn their wrath. Kijimunā thus wronged have been known to murder livestock, sabotage boats so they sink while their owners are far out at sea, or magically trap people in hollow trees from which they cannot escape. Sometimes they press down on peoples’ chests while they sleep, or snuff out lights during the night. Once earned, the enmity of a kijimunā can never be assuaged.",,,,

Their body size averages between two to three centimeters long, but they can grow much larger; some are massive enough to catch and eat small birds.

They also have powerful venom that can slowly weaken a man day by day, allowing the spider to savor her victim’s long and painful death. Jorōgumo can control other, lesser spiders, even employing fire-breathing spiders to burn down the homes of any suspicious meddlers.

When his wounds were not healing and the medicine didn’t seem to be working, Yorimitsu suspected foul play. He slashed his sword at the boy, who then fled into the forest. The attack broke the powerful illusion which the spider had laid on Yorimitsu, and he found that he was covered in spider webs.

Aosagibi is the name for a bizarre phenomenon caused by transformed herons—particularly the black-crowned night heron. Found all along the islands and coasts, this heron prefers remote areas with heavy reeds and thick woods. Though aosagibi is most commonly attributed to this particular bird, other herons and wild birds such as ducks and pheasants are able to develop this manifestation. Aosagibi is most commonly seen at night, either in the trees where the herons roost, by the rivers where they hunt, or in the twilight sky as birds fly overhead.","Long-lived herons develop shining scales on their breasts, which fuse together from their feathers. With each breath, they blow a yellow iridescent powder from their beaks that scatters into the wind. During the autumn nights, their bodies radiate a bluish-white glow. Their powdery breath ignites into bright blue fireballs, which they blow across the water or high in the trees. These fireballs possess no heat and do not ignite what they touch, but eventually evaporate in the wind.","Like most wild birds, night herons are shy and flee from humans. Even after transforming into yōkai, they retain their shyness. While the sight of a colony of wild birds breathing blue flames and making strange calls on a cool autumn night can be rather disconcerting, aosagibi does not post any threat. However, because their fireball breath appears similar to other phenomena, caution should be taken to avoid confusing aosagibi with onibi or other supernatural lights.",,,,,

As a result, they are mistrusted and disliked. Itachi calls are also considered to be ill omens. After the yelping cries of a group of itachi are heard, misfortune and despair always follows. Though itachi can transform, they prefer to use other kinds of magic—usually with unfortunate results for their targets. When an itachi is seen standing on its hind legs it is said to be bewitching a human—perhaps hypnotizing them into leaving out food or performing some other task for the weasel’s benefit. Itachi are dangerous in groups. They gather together at night, climb up onto each other’s shoulders, and create huge columns of fire which erupt into whirlwinds. These are frequently blamed for starting conflagrations which can burn down entire towns.",,"In the old days, weasels were believed to transform into ten (martens) or mujina (badgers or tanuki, depending on the region) after reaching an old age. Additionally, the names ten and itachi were often used interchangeably. As a result, there is confusion over which animal is being referred to in many stories.",,"Itachi are often considered to be the most skilled shape-changing animals, possessing more forms than any other shape-changer. An old phrase about animal yōkai goes, “Kitsune nanabake, tanuki hachibake, ten kubake”—foxes seven forms, tanuki eight forms, martens (i.e. itachi) nine forms. When an itachi changes its shape, it usually adopts the form of a young priest boy dressed in clothes that are too big for him. This form is used chiefly to acquire alcohol, which the weasels cannot brew. Itachi also frequently adopt the forms of other yōkai in order to scare humans.

They come and go with the wind.",,"Kama itachi travel and attack in threes, striking out at people from thin air. The first kama itachi slices at its victim’s legs, knocking him to the ground. The second one uses its fore and hind legs to slice up the prone victim with thousands of dreadful cuts. The third one then applies a magical salve which heals up the majority of the wounds instantly, so that none of them proves fatal. It is said that the kama itachi strikes with such precision that it can carve out entire chunks of flesh from its victims without spilling even a drop of blood. The attack and the healing happen so fast that the victim cannot perceive them; from his perspective he merely trips and gets up with a bit of pain and a few scratches here and there.",,"One theory about the kama itachi’s origin is that it is only a joke: a play on words based on a sword fighting stance known as kamae tachi.

However, the flame gives off no heat, nor does it ignite combustible material.","Basan are entirely nocturnal, and little is known about their behavior. They make their homes in remote bamboo groves, far from human activity. Charred wood and embers make up their diet, and they have been known to wander into remote villages at night to feast on the remains of bonfires or charcoal.

Short creatures resembling boys of about 10 years of age, their heads are crowned in long brown hair and their bodies are covered in fine, light hair. They have a short torso and two long legs, on which they walk upright. A yamawaro’s most distinguishing feature is the single eye in the middle of its head. They are skillful mimics, copying the sound of falling rocks, wind, dynamite, and tools. They can even learn to speak human languages and sing human songs.",,"Like their cousins the kappa, yamawaro despise horses and cows, and attack them on sight. They love the sport of sumo, which they are better at than any human. Like hyōsube, they sneak into homes to nap and take baths, and leave behind a thick film of grease and hair when they are done.","Yamawaro are frequently encountered in the mountains by woodcutters, and are known to help with work. If properly thanked and offered food for their services, a yamawaro is likely to return to help again. However, care must be taken when feeding a yamawaro. If the amount of food is less than what was promised, it will grow angry and never return. If offered before the work is performed, the yamawaro will simply take the food and run.
This theory is supported by the fact that these creatures share so many traits in common with one another, and because it is extremely rare to see garappa in the winter. However, it is also possible that these aquatic yōkai go into hibernation during the colder months, and that the similarities between garappa and yamawaro are simply coincidence.","One theory from Kumamoto Prefecture says that yamawaro and garappa are actually different forms of the same yōkai. During the cold months, these creatures live in the mountains as yamawaro (or yamawarawa, as they are known locally). During the warm months, they live in lakes and rivers as garappa. Every year on the autumn equinox, all of the country’s garappa transform into yamawaro and travel from the rivers to the mountains in a mass migration. They return on the spring equinox and transform back into garappa. Villagers who build their houses in the pathway of these massive yōkai migrations are prone to find holes, gashes, and other damage caused by yamawaro angry at having their path blocked. People who witness the springtime return of the yamawaro often catch deadly fevers.",,,

The noise from the splash scares the yōkai away. Nearly all encounters with azuki arai are purely auditory; they are notoriously shy, and do all they can to avoid being seen.

Though similar in name and habit to their azuki-related cousins, azuki hakari have traits distinct enough to classify them as separate yōkai.","Azuki hakari appear in homes late at night, after midnight. An encounter usually begins with the sound of heavy footsteps in the space between the attic and the roof. Shortly after, a rhythmic sound like dried azuki beans being scattered can be heard against the windows or sliding doors leading outside. The sound grows progressively louder, and gradually changes into the sound of splashing water, then finally to the sound of geta—Japanese wooden sandals—walking just outside the room. Opening the doors or windows causes the noise to stop, revealing no sign of any creature; nor any beans or puddles or markings",,"Because of the difficulty of direct observation of all azuki spirits, it is likely that some of the stories about azuki arai may in fact be about encounters with azuki hakari, especially those which take place near homes or away from rivers.",,,,

Azuki babā appear only at twilight—particularly on rainy or misty autumn nights. Their song is similar to the azuki arai’s, except that azuki babā follow through on the threat to catch and eat humans.","Witnesses of azuki babā describe an eerie, white glow visible through a thick, white mist. From the mist, they hear the husky voice of an old hag singing her ghastly song and counting beans as she washes them in the river with a strainer.

Other variations exist in different colors and with different numbers of horns, eyes, or fingers and toes. They wear loincloths made of the pelts of great beasts. All oni possess extreme strength and constitution, and many of them are accomplished sorcerers. They are ferocious demons, bringers of disaster, spreaders of disease, and punishers of the damned in hell.","Oni are born when truly wicked humans die and end up in one of the many Buddhist hells. Transformed into oni, they become the ogreish and brutal servants of Great Lord Enma, ruler of hell. Wielding great iron clubs, they crush and destroy humans solely for enjoyment. An oni’s job is to mete out horrible punishments such as peeling off skins, crushing bones, and rendering other torments too horrible to describe. All these tortures are for wicked sinners—but only those not quite wicked enough to be reborn as oni themselves. Hell is full of oni. They make up the armies of the great generals of the underworld.","Oni are the stuff of legends and fairy tales. Japanese mythology is full of countless stories of oni encounters with lords and ladies, warriors and rogues. No two stories about oni are exactly alike except for one thing—oni are always the villains of mankind.","Occasionally, when a human is so utterly wicked that his soul is beyond any redemption, he transforms into an oni while still alive. He then remains on earth to terrorize the living. These transformed oni are the ones most legends tell about, and the ones who pose the most danger to humankind.","Originally, all spirits, ghosts, and monsters were known as oni. The root of their name is a word meaning “hidden” or “concealed,” and it was written with the Chinese character for ghost. In the old days of Japan, before the spirits were well-cataloged, oni could refer to almost any supernatural creature—ghosts, obscure gods, large or scary yōkai, even particularly vicious and brutal humans.

Tales show oni working either as tormentors of the damned or as menaces to human society in the living world, but kijo do not seem to have any connection to hell or the afterlife.

It is perhaps through this mystic religion that humankind was eventually able to earn the respect of the tengu. Brave men ventured into the unknown wilds in hopes of gaining some of the tengu’s wisdom. Occasionally, tengu would teach secrets and impart magical knowledge to the worthiest of these men. One of Japan’s most famous warriors, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, is said to have learned swordsmanship from the tengu king Sōjōbō.",,,,,
https://yokai.com/oonyuudou/,Ōnyūdō,大入道,おおにゅうどう,giant priest,many variations and different kinds exist,any; usually found in mountainous regions,varies; most commonly livestock or humans,"Ōnyūdō is a catch-all term for a number of giants found throughout Japan. The name is used in a euphemistic way; while some ōnyūdō bear a strong resemblance to Buddhist priests and monks, most have no actual relation to the clergy. Size, appearance, and mannerisms vary from region to region and account to account. Some giants are only slightly larger than a human while others are as big as a mountain. Some are saviors of men, while others are man-eaters.","Ōnyūdō can be separated into four general groups: those that harm humans; those that help humans; transformations of other yōkai; and other, truly unique ōnyūdō that do not fit into any of these categories.",,"Ōnyūdō that harm humans are by far the broadest category. Among them are well-known yōkai, such as hitotsume nyūdō, mikoshi nyūdō, and the ocean going umi bōzu. These giants delight in terrorizing humans— sometimes hunting them to eat, sometimes pillaging and destroying villages out of rage, and other times terrifying lone travelers just for the fun of it.
Ōnyūdō that help humans are much rarer. They have been known to perform good deeds such as turning stuck waterwheels, moving heavy objects, or doing other things that require incredible amounts of strength. Though helpful, they are not always friendly. Ōnyūdō can change from benevolent to violent with little warning.
Helpful or harmful, true ōnyūdō are actually rare. Transformed yōkai—especially tanuki and itachi—make up a large percentage of the giant population. Shape-shifting yōkai take on giant form in order to scare people and cause mischief, though they rarely kill. There is no easy way to identify if a giant is a true ōnyūdō or just a shape-shifter. The two are functionally indistinguishable.
And then there are the remainder of the ōnyūdō—enigmatic and mysterious. They are only evidenced by their footprints or discarded trash. Regardless of how good or evil at heart a particular ōnyūdō is, they are by nature extremely dangerous. It is generally wise to leave them be. Better to avoid all contact with them than risk enraging an ōnyūdō and bringing destruction upon nearby villages.",,,,

They dress in luxurious robes and travel in enormous, ornate palanquins carried by lesser yōkai or human slaves. Their palanquins are surrounded by a splendid precession fit for a corrupt abbot or a rich lord. The fantastic procession is enough to make most travelers stop and stare, speculating about what nobleman or lady might be riding inside. But when the palanquin stops and a hitotsume nyūdō comes strolling out, it means trouble for any curious gawkers.","Hitotsume nyūdō are one of the most demonic types of ōnyūdō. They roam the roads and highways outside of the cities, assaulting lone travelers unfortunate enough to get in their way. Like many giants, they are able to increase and decrease their size at will. They can grow taller than the highest trees and trample forests to crush any who might be hiding within. With their long legs they are faster than any human. Running away is impossible. Like many ōnyūdō, hitotsume nyūdō attacks are blamed on mischievous kitsune or tanuki disguised by transformation magic; and occasionally this is true.",,"Another hitotsume nyūdō, frequently seen outside of Kyōto, was said to be the reincarnation of a particularly fierce abbot of Enryaku-ji. Renowned for his strict discipline, in life he was known for expelling lazy monks from his temple. He saw the world as growing increasingly secular and wicked, and he constantly lamented and criticized the corruption and sin of the monks of his day. After his death, it is said he was reincarnated into a yōkai. This allowed him to continue punishing the wicked and impious clergy.",,"A legend from Wakayama tells how a man, traveling along a wooded road, came across a splendid procession unlike any he had ever seen. Entranced, he climbed a tree to get a better look. As the procession approached, it stopped just as it reached his tree. There was a frighteningly large palanquin, and out from it stepped a giant, one-eyed monster. The creature went after the man, climbing the tree he was hiding in. In a panic the man swung his sword at the creature. At the moment he did so, the hitotsume nyūdō and the entire procession vanished.",,

This causes the person to look up so high and fast that they lose their balance and tumble backwards. That’s when the mikoshi nyūdō lunges forward and bites their throat out with its teeth.","Those unfortunate enough to meet this cruel yōkai usually do not live to tell the tale. Much depends on the person’s reaction. If they try to ignore and walk past the mikoshi nyūdō, the angry giant will crush them or pierce them with bamboo spears and branches. The same fate is met by those who turn and try to run away. People who stare at the mikoshi nyūdō frozen in fear will drop dead on the spot, overcome by its presence.","The only possible escape is to anticipate the mikoshi nyūdō (thus its name). Meet it face-to-face, eye-to-eye, and show no fear. Then, look from its head down to its feet, rather than starting at the feet and looking up. If done properly, the giant’s power to grow will be sapped. Telling the giant, “You lost! I anticipated your trick!” causes it to vanish in anger, leaving the traveler to pass safely along.",,,"Mikoshi nyūdō is a popular form of some shape-shifting animals. In particular, itachi and tanuki transform into these giants in order to hunt humans. Kitsune and mujina are known to occasionally take this form as well, though less often. When a mikoshi nyūdō is result of a transformation, it carries a bucket, a lantern, or some other tool. This tool is where the shape-shifter’s true body is stored. If you can snatch the object away from the giant before it attacks, the spell is broken and the transformed yōkai will be at its captor’s mercy.",

Some say they can also be outsmarted by carrying a ruler or other measuring utensils and attempting to calculate their height before it can react. The confused giant usually leaves in disgust and will not bother the same person again.","Taka nyūdō are generally less violent than other giants.

Though its origins are a mystery, it is commonly believed that abura sumashi are the ghosts of oil thieves who escaped into the woods. Oil was a difficult and expensive commodity to make.

This revelation usually ends these happy marriages.","A man from Niigata Prefecture claimed that he had been married to a yuki onna. His wife was beautiful, with piercing eyes and skin as white as a marble statue. While he loved to take long hot baths every night, his wife always refused to bathe. This puzzled him greatly.

These stories are rarely violent; usually the shōjō flee into the water after stealing a few barrels of sake.",,"The name shōjō is the Japanese version of the Chinese name for these ape-like spirit, xīng xīng. The name connotes liveliness, a fitting match for the personality of this creature.

They are exceedingly cruel and savage. They breath toxic poison, and eat humans. Some ushi oni are lurkers, attacking people who draw too close to their lairs; others are hunters, roaming the coasts seeking prey.

There are two variations of this yōkai: one without arms, which resembles an enormous sea serpent with a woman’s head, and one with human-like arms. Aside from this difference, the two look and act in exactly the same manner. Their faces are hideous and betray serpent-like features such as a forked tongue. They have long black hair which sticks to their dripping bodies. Their name comes from the fact that they always appear soaking wet.",,"While physically much stronger than a human, nure onna prefer not to rely on brute force and use trickery and guile to catch their prey. They most often appear near the water, on a coast or by a riverbank. Nure onna magically disguise themselves as a distressed woman carrying a bundled up baby. They cry out for help from fishers, sailors, or anybody passing by. When the prey approaches, a nure onna will plead with their victim to hold her baby for just a moment so that she can rest. If he agrees and takes the bundle, the “baby” becomes as heavy as a boulder. The victim is unable to move.

Eventually he leaves just as he came, quietly and politely slipping out of the house and into his palanquin, as the owners of the house obsequiously bow and wave him farewell. Only after he has left does anyone become suspicious of the mysterious old man who just visited.","In Okayama Prefecture, some evidence links nurarihyon to umi bōzu. There, nurarihyon are globe-shaped sea creatures, about the size of a man’s head, which float about in the Seto Inland Sea. When fisherman try to catch one, the sphere sinks down into the water just out of reach, and then bobs back up mockingly. It has been theorized that some of these slippery globes migrate to land, where they gradually gain influence and power, becoming the nurarihyon known throughout the rest of Japan. Whether this theory is the true origin of the Supreme Commander of All Monsters or just one more of his many mysteries has yet to be solved.",As to nurarihyon’s origins there is only speculation. The oldest records of his existence are mere sketches and paintings. His name comes from nurari (“to slip away”) and hyon (an onomatopoeia describing floating upwards) written with the kanji for gourd (due to the shape of his head). This connotes a slippery evasiveness—which he employs when posing as master of the house.,,,

She calls single young men over to her, and they are seldom able to resist her charms. Until of course, they get too close….",,,"From behind, an ohaguro bettari looks like a beautiful woman wearing a kimono—often looking like a newlywed in her bridal gown. She appears at twilight outside of a temple, or inside a man’s own house, disguised as his wife. At first, she conceals her head, or turns away from any viewers. Any man who comes closer to get a better look is surprised when she turns to reveal her face: an ugly, white, featureless dome slathered in thick makeup, containing nothing but a huge, gaping mouth full of blackened teeth. She follows up this initial shock with a horrible cackle, sending the man running away and screaming in terror.","Ohaguro bettari are similar to a yōkai called nopperabō in appearance and demeanor. Like nopperabō they are often blamed on shape-shifting pranksters like kitsune, tanuki, or mujina looking to have a laugh at the expense of an unwitting human. It has also been suggested that they are the ghosts of ugly women who were unable to marry. Accurate eye-witness reports are hard to come by due to the embarrassment of the victims at having fallen for such an obvious gag. However as no deaths or injuries (other than to pride) have been attributed to ohaguro bettari, and because sightings are rare, a mischievous shape-shifting animal yōkai seems to be a plausible explanation.",,,

While traveling, Oyotsu became sick. Treating her would have used up all of their travel money, so the monk murdered Oyotsu and stole the remaining money. On his travels, he stayed at an inn owned by a man with a beautiful daughter. The wicked monk shared a bed with the innkeeper’s daughter, and during the night her neck stretched and her face changed into that of Oyotsu. She angrily accused him of murdering her. The next morning the monk, regretting his evil deeds, confessed the murder of Oyotsu to the innkeeper. The monk also told the innkeeper what he had seen the night before. The innkeeper confessed that he, too, had murdered his wife for her money. He used the money to build his inn, and as a punishment his own daughter was transformed into a rokurokubi. Afterwards, the monk rejoined his temple, built a grave for Oyotsu, and prayed for her soul every day. What happened to the innkeeper’s daughter is never mentioned.","Unlike most yōkai which are born as monsters, rokurokubi and their close relatives nukekubi are former humans—transformed by a curse resulting from some evil or misdeed. Perhaps they sinned against the gods or nature, or perhaps they were unfaithful to their husbands. In many cases, their husbands or fathers actually committed the sin. By some cruel twist of fate the men escape punishment and the women receive the curse instead. In any case, the rokurokubi curse only affects women.","A lord noticed that the oil in his lamps was vanishing at an alarming rate, and suspected one of his servant girls might be a rokurokubi. He decided to spy upon the girl. After she had fallen asleep, he crept into her room and watched over her. Soon he noticed vapors and ectoplasm forming around her chest and neck. A little while later, the servant girl rolled over in her sleep, however only her body moved! The head stayed in its place, and the neck lay stretched out between the two. The next day he fired her. She was fired from every place at which she subsequently worked. The poor girl never understood why she had such back luck with her employment. She never found out that she was a rokurokubi.",,

Their flying head sucks the blood of victims like a vampire. Nukekubi also brutally bite humans and animals to death.",,"According to lore from Hitachi, a man married to a nukekubi heard from a peddler that the liver of a white-haired dog could remove the curse. He had such a dog, and killed it and fed its liver to his wife. Sure enough she was cured of the affliction. However, her curse was still passed on to her daughter, whose flying head took to biting white dogs to death. Other accounts claim that by removing the sleeping body to a safe place during the night, the head will not be able return, and will eventually die—however this is not a cure that most families are willing to try.","Like the rokurokubi, being a nukekubi is considered a curse. Edo period scientists believed that nukekubi suffered from an infliction similar to somnambulism; only instead of walking about at night the patient’s entire soul and head depart from the body. Uncured, this curse has the potential to tear a family apart, particularly due to its violent nature. Treatments for the curse of the rokurokubi and nukekubi have been long sought after—particularly because these women can often pass their curse on to their daughters who shows signs as they mature. Afflicted girls were sold off to live in brothels or human circuses, or forced to commit suicide in order to preserve their families’ honor.","A famous account from Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture) tells of a young woman afflicted with the curse of the nukekubi. Her head flew about the capital city at night, chasing young men through the streets all the way back to their houses. Locked out, the head would scratch and bite their doors and gates during the night and leave deep gashes in the wood. When the young girl eventually discovered her curse, she was so ashamed that she asked her husband for a divorce. She ritually cut off all of her hair in repentance and committed suicide. She believed it was better to die than to live the rest of her life as a monster.",,

Futakuchi onna appear as regular women until their terrible secret is revealed: in the back of their skulls—buried beneath long, thick hair—is a second mouth, full of teeth and with large, fat lips. This second mouth is ravenous, and uses long strands of its hair-like tentacles to gorge itself on any food it can find.",,,"One day, the miser pretended to leave for work. In truth he stayed behind to spy on his new wife. As the miser watched from a hidden location, his wife untied her hair, and revealed a second mouth on the back of her head, complete with ghastly lips and teeth. Her hair reached out with tentacle-like stalks and began to scoop rice balls into the second mouth, which cooed out with pleasure in a vulgar, raspy voice.
The miser was horrified and resolved to divorce his wife as soon as possible. However, she learned of his plan before he could act on it, and trapped him in a bathtub and carried him off into the mountains. The miser managed to escape. He hid in a heavily scented lily marsh where the futakuchi onna could not find him.
Another story tells of a wicked stepmother who always gave plenty of food to her own daughter, but never enough to her stepdaughter. Gradually the stepdaughter grew sicker and sicker, until she starved to death. Forty-nine days later, the wicked stepmother was afflicted with a terrible headache. The back of her head split open, and lips, teeth, and a tongue formed. This new mouth ached with debilitating pain until it was fed, and it shrieked in the voice of the dead stepdaughter. From then on the stepmother always had to feed both of her mouths, and always felt the hunger pangs of the stepdaughter she murdered.","In the folk tales of Japan’s eastern regions, futakuchi onna are most often thought to be shape-changed yama uba posing as young women. In the western regions they are frequently shape-changed kumo, or magical spiders. In the other tales they are the result of curses brought about by wicked deeds, similar to rokuro kubi. In each story, regardless of its true nature, this yōkai is used as a punishment upon a greedy man or woman for wickedness and extreme parsimony.","One story tells of how in a small rural village in Fukushima there lived a stingy miser. Because he could not bear the thought of paying for food to support a family, the miser lived entirely by himself. One day he met a woman who did not eat anything at all, and he immediately took her for his wife. The miser was thrilled with her because she never ate a thing and was still a hard worker.

A hari onago’s strength is so great that even the strongest man can be overpowered by her hooks. Once her victim is ensnared and rendered helpless, she rips him into pieces with her hooks and devours the remains.","It is technically possible for a very fast runner to escape a hari onago, providing his home is close enough and has a sturdy door or gate. If he can get himself safely indoors before her hooks catch him, he may be able to survive until sunrise—when yōkai vanish.

Accounts usually describe lords sending hosts of warriors to chase the creature out of a castle or a temple, only to have it outrun the guards and escape, causing some of them to swoon and faint from its odor. Though they are passive and non-aggressive, they can move quickly and are notoriously hard to catch.","According to the records of Edo period pharmacists, its flesh imparts incredible power on those who eat it (providing they are willing and able to keep it down), and it can also be made into a powerful medicine with excellent curative properties.","Nuppeppō’s origins are mysterious. They are believed to be a distant relative of nopperabō. Some scholars suggest that nuppeppō may in fact be botched transformations of inexperienced shape-shifting yōkai, such as a mujina or tanuki. The origin of their name is equally mysterious. It is thought to be derived from slang for wearing too much makeup, painted so thickly that facial features become indiscernible—just as nuppeppō’s features are barely discernible on their fleshy, fatty faces.",,,

They wear shaved heads and robes, like tiny Buddhist monks. They have long red tongues and a single, enormous eye.","Hitotsume kozō are relatively harmless as far as yōkai go. Their most alarming trait is appearing suddenly and surprising people on dark streets. They seem to enjoy startling people; hundreds of encounters have been reported over the years, most of them very similar to each other.","Aside from their startling play, hitotsume kozō have one serious job. In East Japan, it is said that every year on the 8th of December, hitotsume kozō travel the land, recording in ledgers the families who have been bad that year. They use this information to decide each family’s fortunes for the coming year. Hitotsume kozō take their reports to the god of pestilence and bad luck, who then brings appropriate misfortune on those deserving families. However, hitotsume kozō leave their ledgers with the guardian deity of travels for safekeeping until February 8th. In a mid-January ceremony, local villagers burn down and rebuild that deity’s roadside shrines in hopes that the fires will also burn the hitotsume kozō’s ledgers before they come to pick them up—thus escaping disaster that year.","In an account from Fukushima Prefecture, a young lady was walking the street at night. A little boy approached her from behind and asked “Ma’am, would you like some money.” She laughed and sweetly replied yes, and turned to face the boy. He was a hitotsume kozō. Instead of bearing riches and he was grinning, staring so intensely at her with his single eye that she fainted in shock on the spot.
A similar tale from Okayama Prefecture tells of a particular street where an eerie, pale blue glow was seen one night. A man went to investigate and witnessed a ghostly one-eyed boy playing around. The man collapsed, paralyzed with fear, and was unable to move. The apparition approached the helpless man and licked him from head to toe with his long, slobbery tongue.","Though similar in name to other one-eyed monsters like hitotsume nyūdō, there is little evidence suggesting a relation between the two. Many believe that hitotsume kozō’s origins are connected in some way with Enryaku-ji, the head temple of the Tendai sect of Buddhism. Others believe that they were once local mountain deities who over time devolved and changed into yōkai.","A man visited a friend on business. While waiting in the reception room, a young boy of about 10 appeared and began to mischievously roll and unroll the hanging scroll in the room’s alcove. When the man scolded the boy for being mischievous, the boy turned around and squawked, “Be quiet!” However, the boy’s face had only one eye! The man screamed and fainted, and had to be carried back to his own home. He was bed-ridden for 20 days, but made a full recovery.",,

This troubled attachment manifests as a ghost known as an ubume. These women appear on dark, rainy nights. Ubume can appear in many forms: a woman carrying a baby; a pregnant woman; or a blood-soaked walking corpse carrying an underdeveloped fetus. Other times they just appear as horrific, bloody, pregnant women crying out desperately into the night for help.","These tragic spirits wander the areas near where they died, seeking aid from the living which they cannot provide themselves. If the mother died after childbirth but her baby survived, the newly formed ubume will try to care for the child in whatever way it can. She enters shops or homes to try to purchase food, clothes, or sweets for her still-living child. In place of money she pays with handfuls of dead leaves. These ghosts also try to lead humans to the place where their baby is hidden so that it can be taken to its living relatives, or adopted by another person.",,"These variations are due to the burial traditions of different regions, as well as the circumstances of their death. In some areas, when a pregnant woman died she would be buried with the unborn fetus still inside of her. In other places, the fetus would be cut out of her and placed in her arms during burial. Women who died after delivering stillborn babies were also buried this way.
In cases where both mother and child died, an ubume can appear carrying the bundled corpse of her infant. When a human approaches, the ghost tries to deliver the bundle into the arms of the living. If the stranger accepts, the ghost vanishes, and the bundle grows heavier and heavier until the helpful stranger is crushed under its weight.",,,"The name ubume is written with characters that imply a bird’s name. The literal translation of these characters is “child-snatching bird” and some theories connect this spirit with another yōkai called the ubumetori. This yōkai is an evil bird which flies through the sky searching for clothing that has been left on the clothesline overnight. When it finds some, it smears its poisonous blood on the clothing. Shortly afterward, the owner of those clothes begins to develop shakes and convulsions; possibly leading to death. Ubumetori are also blamed for snatching babies and taking them away into the night sky. Whether this bird is another form of the ghostly mother or a separate spirit with a similar name is not known.",

In most cases, how they appear depends on the circumstances on their death. They retain the features and the clothing they wore when they died or were buried, which means they are dressed in white burial kimonos or the uniforms of fallen warriors. Occasionally, they have bloody wounds indicative of the way they died. Their hair is usually long and disheveled, often obstructing their face and adding to their disturbing appearance. Their hands hang limply from their wrists. Yūrei are translucent and only faintly visible. In most cases they are so faint that they appear to have no feet.",,"Yūrei are capable of invoking powerful curses. They do not roam about, but haunt one particular place or person. In the case of a place it is often where they died or are buried. In the case of a person it is often their killer—or sometimes their loved ones. They remain stuck in this world until they can be put to rest. This might require bringing their killers to justice, or finding their lost body, or something as simple as passing on a message to a loved one. Some yūrei are reluctant to accept their own deaths and haunt their living family, bringing misfortune and unhappiness for the rest of their family members’ lives.","Each haunting is as unique as the person it originated from. Only when its purpose for existing is fulfilled—or it is exorcised by a priest—can a yūrei finally rest. But the possibility that salvation exists is a glimmer of hope for those who are affected by a haunting.
Those who do not receive the proper funeral rites cannot pass on. They remain stuck in a purgatory that is part physical world and part ethereal. Others who die suddenly, tragically, or violently—or with grudge and malice in their hearts—are sometimes unable to pass on even with the proper prayers and rites. These lost souls transform into yūrei.","According to traditional Japanese beliefs, when a person dies his soul lives on as a separate entity, passing on to a heavenly afterlife. This transition is accomplished through a number of funeral and post-funeral rites and prayers performed by their loved ones over many years. Through these rites, the soul is reunited with its ancestors and becomes a family guardian spirit. These ancestors are enshrined in the house and continue to be honored as members of the family, particularly during the summer holiday of Obon when they are said to return to the material world to be with their families.",,,

Instead, they transform into powerful, wrathful spirits who seek vengeance on everything they encounter. Often they were victims of war, catastrophe, betrayal, murder, or suicide—and they display wounds or marks indicative of the way they died.",,"Their motive is always the same—vengeance. Onryō are easily powerful enough to kill anyone. However, they prefer letting the object of their hatred live a long life of torment and suffering, watching loved ones die in their stead. Onryō inflict a terrible curse on the people or places that they haunt. This curse can be transmitted to others like a contagious disease, creating a circle of death and destruction far more devastating than any ordinary ghost. Onryō make no distinction in their targets; they just want to destroy. Moreover, an onryō’s vengeance can never be satisfied. While most yūrei only haunt a person or place until they are exorcised or placated, an onryō’s horrible grudge-curse continues to infect a location long after the ghost itself has been laid to rest.","Occasionally, an onryō’s curse is born not out of hatred and retribution, but from an intense, passionate love that perverts into jealousy. These onryō haunt their former lovers, exacting their wrath on new romances, second marriages, new children, and eventual end up destroying the lives of the ones they loved so much in life. Whatever the origin, an onryō’s undiscriminating wrath makes it one of the most feared supernatural entities in all of Japan.",,"Unquestionably the most well-known onryō, and one whose grudge-curse exists to this very day, is the ghost of Oiwa. A young woman who was brutally disfigured and then murdered by her wicked and greedy husband in an elaborate plot, her story is told in Yotsuya kaidan, or The Ghost Story of Yotsuya. Yotsuya kaidan has been retold many times, in books, ukiyoe, kabuki, and film. Like Shakespeare’s Macbeth, legend has it that a curse accompanies her story, and that those who retell it suffer injuries and even death. To this day, producers, actors, and their crews continue to visit the grave of Oiwa in Tōkyō before productions or adaptations of Yotsuya kaidan, praying for her soul and asking for her blessing to tell her story once again.",,

Like many yōkai of this kind, their main activity seems to be scaring humans. This they do remarkably well. Nopperabō usually appear in the guise of a man or a woman with his or her back turned towards the observer. When approached, the yōkai turns around and reveals its terrifying true form. To maximize the effect, they often appear with a face at first, and then wipe their face off dramatically with their hand at the most opportune time. Nopperabō revel in the terror they inflict upon their unsuspecting victims.","Nopperabō often work together in groups to scare one individual. As their victim runs away in a panic from the first nopperabō, he runs into another person who asks him what is wrong. When the victim explains what he saw, this person replies, “Oh, you mean like this?” and wipes his face away exactly like the first nopperabō.

To further complicate matters, in some regions tanuki are called mujina, while mujina are called tanuki. In other regions the term mami applies to both animals.","Mujina are less famous as yōkai than other shape-changing animals. As they live in the mountains, generally far from human society, they are not encountered as frequently as other animal yōkai. They are shy, and do not like to be seen by or interact with humans.

They are similar to kitsune in their superb ability to change shape. Tanuki have a jovial nature, and delight in playing tricks on humans.","In the ancient religions of the Japanese isles, tanuki were considered gods and rulers over all things in nature. With the introduction of Buddhism, they gradually lost their status. Like other magical animals, they took on the roles of messengers of the gods and guardians of local areas. While tanuki are not generally feared or considered malicious, they are not entirely harmless either. Like humans, each one is a unique individual. While many tanuki are jovial do-gooders who love the company of humans, some local tales tell of horrible tanuki who snatch humans to eat, or spirit them away to become servants of the gods.","Aside from their powerful ability to change their shape, perhaps the most famous attribute that tanuki possess is their massive, malleable, magical testicles which they can adapt to any need. Their testicles can be used as weapons, drums, fans to keep cool, fishing nets—even umbrellas. Often, tanuki incorporate their testicles into their disguises: the tanuki becoming a shopkeeper and its testicles transforming into the shop; or perhaps a palanquin complete with servants to cart the tanuki from place to place. A famous nursery rhyme about tanuki testicles is learned by children everywhere:
Tan tan tanuki no kintama wa/Kaze mo nai no ni/Bura bura
Tan-tan-tanuki’s balls/Even when there is no wind/They swing, swing

When they can be seen, zashiki warashi appear as ghostly children, five or six years old and with blushing red faces. The boys are dressed in child-sized warrior costumes and the girls in patterned kimonos and with hair that is either short and bobbed or long and tied back.

https://yokai.com/inugami/,Inugami,犬神,いぬがみ,"dog god, dog spirit","in’game, irigami",towns and cities; usually in the service of wealthy families,"carnivorous, though they are usually starved on purpose","Inugami are a kind of familiar, or spirit of possession, which are found in Kyushu, Shikoku, and elsewhere in West Japan. In public, an inugami looks identical to an ordinary dog in order to blend in with society. However, its true form is that of a desiccated, mummified dog’s head, often dressed up in ceremonial trappings. This is kept safe (and away from prying eyes) in a secret shrine in its owner’s house.","Inugami have much in common with other familiars, such as shikigami and kitsune-tsuki. Inugami are more commonly used in areas where foxes are not found, such as major population centers. There is even evidence of an ancient tradition of Inugami worship stretching from Western Japan down to Okinawa. Powerful sorcerers were said to be able to create these spirits through monstrous ceremonies and use them to all sorts of nefarious deeds. Inugami serve their masters loyally, performing tasks just like a faithful dog. They are loyal to one person or one family only, and unless seriously mistreated they remain loyal forever; these spirits can be passed down from generation to generation like an heirloom.","Like other tsukimono, or possession spirits, inugami are beings of powerful emotion and are very good at possessing emotionally unstable or weak people. They do so usually by entering through the ears and settling into the internal organs. People who have found themselves possessed by an inugami — or even if it was only suspected that a person might be possessed — were in for some serious misfortune. The only way to be cured of inugami-tsuki is to hire another sorcerer to remove it. This could take a very, very long time and involve a lot of money. Signs of inugami possession include chest pain, pain in the hands, feet, or shoulders, feelings of deep jealousy, and suddenly barking like a dog. Some victims develop intense hunger and turn into gluttons, and it is said that people who die while possessed by an inugami are found with markings all over their body resembling the teeth and claw marks of a dog. Not only humans, but animals like cows and horses, or even inanimate objects, can be possessed by inugami. Tools possessed by such a spirit become totally and completely unusable.","The technique for creating these fetishes was passed down along bloodlines, and such families are known as inugami-mochi. These families would keep their inugami hidden in the back rooms of their houses, under their beds, in dressers, or hidden among water jars. It is said that a family owned as many inugami as there were members of the household, and when a new person joined the family, they too received their own familiar. Inugami were treated like family members by inugami-mochi families, and most of the time would quickly run out to do their master’s bidding any time their master wanted something. However, like living dogs, occasionally a resentful inugami might betray a master that grew too abusive or domineering, savagely biting him to death. And while inugami, like other familiar spirits, were created to bring wealth and prosperity to their families, occasionally they might also cause a family to fall into ruin.
Practicing this sort of black magic was illegal and strongly frowned upon, although that didn’t stop the aristocracy from dabbling in sorcery, known as onmyōdō. If an inugami-mochi family was even suspected of cursing another family, the accused person would be forced to apologize and leave his comfortable estate to live on the outskirts of town, secluded from family, friends, and the comfortable aristocratic life. Even if the alleged victim was eventually cured of his possession, the accused (and all of his offspring for all generations to follow) usually had to maintain a solitary lifestyle, outcast from the rest of society, to be viewed by others as wicked and tainted.","How long the practice of creating inugami begun is unknown. However, by the Heian period (some 1000 years ago, at the height of classical Japanese civilization) the practice had already been outlawed along with the use of other animal spirits as tools of sorcery. According to legend, the creation of an inugami is accomplished like this: the head of a starved dog must be cut off (often this was accomplished by chaining a dog up just out of reach of some food, or else burying it up to its neck, so that it would go berserk out of desperate hunger and its head could be cut off at the point of greatest desperation). Then, the severed head is buried in the street — usually a crossroads where many people pass. The trampling of hundreds or thousands of people over this buried head would add to its stress and cause the animal’s spirit to transform into an onryō (a powerful maleficent spirit). Occasionally these severed heads were said to escape and fly about, chasing after food, animated solely by the onryō’s anger — such was the power of the dog’s hunger. The head was then baked or dried and enshrined in a bowl, after which the spirit could be used as a kind of fetish by a wicked sorcerer, doing whatever he or she commanded for the rest of time.",,,

It also appears in the Heian-period encyclopedia Wamyo Ruijusho (938 CE), and again in the Heike Monogatari (1371 CE), a record of one of Japan’s bloodiest civil wars and most tragic family clans. It has the head of a monkey, the body of a tanuki, the tail of a snake, and the limbs of a tiger. In ancient times it was thought to be a kind of nocturnal bird — it’s call is supposed to sound like that of a White’s thrush — and thus its name is written with a kanji that contains the meanings “night” and “bird.”","Little is known about the nue’s natural habitate and lifestyle. While sightings throughout history have been rare, nue are are considered to be pretty evil monsters. The few times that humans and nue have crossed paths, the results have been disastrous.",,"After the nue was slain, the inhabitants of Kyoto were afraid of a retaliatory curse for killing the beast, so they loaded its body in a ship and sent it down the Kamo river. The boat with the nue’s body eventually washed up on the shore near the village of Ashiya, in Hyogo prefecture. The good citizens of Ashiya removed the nue’s body, built it a burial mound, and gave it a proper funeral.

Neither medicine nor prayers had any effect on his illness, and the source was attributed to some kind of evil spirit which was visiting the palace every night, early in the morning. These events climaxed some days later in a storm which appeared over the imperial palace around 2 AM. Lightning struck the roof, setting it on fire. The emperor summoned the legendary samurai Minamoto no Yorimasa, to deal with the evil spirit. Yorimasa brought his trusted companion, I no Hayata, and his legendary bow which he received from Minamoto no Yorimitsu, to hunt the best. During the night, a strange wind came over them, followed by a black cloud. Yorimasa fired his arrow into the clouds above the palace, and out from the sky came a horrible scream as a nue dropped to the earth. I no Hayata leaped upon the body, dealing it a finishing blow. The emperor immediately recovered from his illness, and rewarded the heroes with the legendary katana Shishiō for their service.

Thinking he sees a girl that he recognizes from behind, a man runs up to the kejōrō to speak with her. When she turns around, her face and body are covered by a thick mat of hair, hiding all of her features. Her victim is shocked by the horrible, hairy monster in front of him, giving her time to attack her victim, tangling him up in her hair and using it to slice him up. Despite this, reports of kejōrō-related fatalities are very rare.","Despite her horrible appearance to humans, the kejōrō is said to be quite popular with yokai. So popular, in fact, that male yokai frequently fight each other over her, competing for her affection. Kejōrō seem to return this devotion as well; in some stories, a kejōrō will cut off her hair and send it to her lover (human or yokai), or tattoo his name into her skin to prove her undying devotion to him.","The earliest records of kejōrō go back to Toriyama Sekien’s “One Hundred Demons of the Past and Present.” There is some debate over his original description as to whether the kejōrō has a normal face under the matte of hair, or whether she is a faceless monster, related to the nopperabō or the ohaguro-bettari, with various yokai researches weighing in on either side of the question.",,,

In other stories, they appear in wheat fields, or on dark, lonely roads.",,"In Shizuoka, ao bōzu are said to appear on spring evenings at sunset in the wheat and barley fields. The transition from night to day is a popular theme in the tradition of in-yō sorcery. Further, the still blue-green leaves of the young barley also have powerful connections to in-yō. Children who go running and playing through the fields in the evening might be snatched up and taken away by an ao bōzu. Thus, good children must go straight home after school and not go tramping through the fields!","In Kagawa, ao bōzu appear late at night to young women and ask them, “Would you like to hang by your neck?” If the woman says no, the ao bōzu disappears without a word. However, if she ignores him or says nothing, he attacks her with lightning speed, knocks her out, and hangs her by the neck.
In Yamaguchi, they are considered minor deities. They appear before humans on the road and challenge them to sumo matches. Because Yamaguchi’s ao bōzu are only as big as children, many a person has foolishly accepted the challenge, only to find himself flung to the ground with god-like strength and potentially lethal speed.
The fact that ao bōzu has only one eye and is revered as a minor god in some places draws a strong parallel with another yokai, the hitotsume-kozō. Because of his similarity, there are theories suggesting a connection to the ancient spirit worship of old Japan. In these shamanistic proto-religions, one-eyed monsters often originated as fallen mountain gods and bringers of evil, sent to do the bidding of larger deities. They could be kept at bay with woven baskets, or other objects with many holes, which the monsters would view as hundreds of eyes and avoid, either out of fear or jealousy.
Because there are so many different accounts, and because there are so many different kinds of nasty priest yokai, it’s impossible to tell which, if any, is the real ao bōzu, and which are variations of other kinds of yokai.","Very little is known about this yokai. Toriyama Sekien was the first to record the ao bōzu, and his illustration came with not a single word of description other than its name. From its name, we can glean a little bit of information; the word ao means blue or green, and can denote immaturity and inexperience. (Another well-known yokai — ao-nyōbō — uses this color in a similar manner.) As the original illustration was black-and-white, it may even be that this yokai was never intended to be colored blue or green, but rather just as a mockery of what Toriyama Sekien saw as a corrupt and unskilled priesthood. Nonetheless, thanks to its name, it is usually depicted in a sickly shade of ao.",,,

When written it implies that this is a gecko yokai, but when spoken it sounds like a newt yokai — and in actuality it refers to a gecko yokai.
Shortly afterwards, 5 women about 5 or 6 inches tall came up to Jingai and complained about how he treated the old man. While they complained, all around them appeared 10,000 more tiny people, with sleeves rolled up and armed with canes. They swarmed upon Jingai and beat him with their canes. It was like an army of tiny, painful ants attacking him. In the distance, he could see their general: a tiny man decked in red and a lacquered samurai helmet. The tiny general called out: “Get out of here and never return, or else we will pop your eyes and slice off your ears and nose!” By now, some tiny men had climbed upon his shoulders, and they began to eat his ears and nose. Jingai brushed them off and ran away.
The monk ran away from the horde to a nearby gatehouse. When he arrived there, there were already thousands of tiny men all over, who knocked him down. The general said to him: “We heard you were rude to our friends. As a punishment, we will cut off your hands and feet!” Thousands of tiny katanas were drawn from their tiny sheathes, and Jingai was surrounded.
Jingai, now terrified, apologized to the little men for not considering their feelings, and asked them to spare him. The general told him that if he was truly sorry, he would let him go, and ordered his men to eject Jingai from the gatehouse. Jingai got the heck out of there.
The next day, reflecting on what had happened, Jingai investigated the direction he came from. He discovered a large hole in the ground that was swarming with geckos. Gathering some local villagers for help, he dug up the hole. It was over 3 meters deep, and full over over 20,000 geckos! Deep inside, he discovered a 12 inch long gecko, which he realized must have been the general.
The eldest villagers explained to Jingai that long ago an ally of Nitta Yoshisada built a castle near there, and it was destroyed in a battle. The the souls of the dead bushi (warriors) and the castle lord haunted the remains of the old castle well. Ever since, they had been causing all kinds of mischief in the area.
Jingai began chanting sutras to give the souls a proper burial, and as he finished chanting, the thousands of geckos were all destroyed. Jingai and the villagers took pity upon the dead beasts. They collected the bodies and burnt them on a funeral pyre, giving them a proper burial, and with the mountain of ashes built a grave for the imori.",,"Long ago, in Echizen province, lived a monk named Jingai Shuso. He was a monk of the Soto school, and was living in hermitage out in the mountains. He lived off of wild mountain plants and whatever charity the people from the local village would bring him, although he spent almost all of him time in secluded meditation. One day was reading in his hermitage near the ruins of Yu-no-o castle when suddenly a small man (about 5 or 6 inches tall) wearing a black hat and carrying a cane appeared and started talking to him. Being a good monk, Jingai did not let the stranger interrupt his studies, and just continued reading. This angered the man, who complained that the monk was ignoring him even though he was standing right there. Again, Jingai ignored the tiny man, who then became very angry. He hopped up on to his cane and flew at Jingai, who brushed him away with his fan. The tiny man fell to the ground and swore revenge on Jindai.",,

As a traveler is walking, right before his or her eyes, an enormous, invisible wall materializes and blocks the way. There is no way to slip around this yokai; it extends itself as far as to the left and right as one might try to go. There is no way over it either, nor can it be knocked down.

Like ordinary sparrows, they are usually found in large flocks, and are very noisy.",,"Yosuzume appear to travelers at night, swirling around them in a creepy, unnatural swarm. By themselves they don’t do any particular harm other than startling people; however they are a sign of very bad luck and are thought to bring terrible evil to those whom they swarm around. Because of this, many locals have superstitious chants which one is supposed to say at night to keep the yosuzume away. Roughly translated, one of them goes: “Chi, chi, chi calls the bird / maybe it wants a branch / if it does, hit it with one.” Another one goes, “Chi, chi, chi calls the bird / please blow soon / divine wind of Ise.”","In some places, yosuzume are known as tamoto suzume, or “sleeve sparrows,” and their appearance was a sign that wolves, wild dogs, or other yokai were nearby. Their call is mysteriously only ever heard by a single individual, even when traveling in groups. It was considered very bad luck if a tamoto suzume should jump into one’s sleeve while walking, and so travelers would hold their sleeves tightly shut when traveling in areas inhabited by these birds.
In other areas, yosuzume are not seen as bad omens, but as warning signs that a more dangerous yokai, the okuri inu, is nearby. For this reason, the yosuzume is also known as the okuri suzume, or “sending sparrow,” and its call is said to be a reminder to travelers to watch their footing on the dangerous mountain paths and to not fall down.",,,,

It stalks them, keeping a safe distance, but following footstep for footstep, as long as they keep walking. If the traveler should trip or stumble, the okuri inu will pounce on them and rip them to shreds. The “sending-off” part of its name comes from the fact that this yokai follows closely behind travelers, trailing behind them as if it were a friend sending them off on their way.","The okuri inu has a special relationship with another yokai, the yosuzume. This eerie bird’s nocturnal song is often a warning that an okuri inu is following you. If one hears the yosuzume’s “chi, chi, chi” song, it is a sign to take extra care to watch one’s footing so that the okuri inu doesn’t have dinner that night.","The okuri inu is somewhat of a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, if one should trip and fall, it will pounce with supernatural speed and gobble him or her up. On the other hand, they are so ferocious that while they are following someone, no other dangerous yokai or wild animals will come close. As long as one keeps his footing, he is safe… but traveling in the dark over root-infested, rocky mountain footpaths, especially for merchants carrying large packs of whatever it is they are going to sell does not make for easy footing!
In the unfortunate case that one should stumble on the road, there is one chance for survival: if you fake it so it looks like you did it on purpose, the okuri inu will be tricked into thinking you were just taking a short rest, and it won’t pursue. You do this by saying, “Dokkoisho!” (“Heave-ho!”) or, “Shindoi wa!” (“This is exhausting!”) and quickly fixing yourself into a sitting position. Sigh, sit for a bit, then continue on your way. The okuri inu will wait patiently for you.
If you should make it out of the mountains safely, you should turn around and call out, “Thanks for seeing me off!” Afterwards, that okuri inu will never follow you again. Further, when you get home, you should wash your feet and leave out a dish of something for the okuri inu to show your gratitude for it watching over you.
In modern Japanese, the word okuri ōkami also applies to predatory men who go after young women, pretending to be sweet and helpful but with ulterior motives. That word comes straight from this yokai.
In Izu and Saitama, their is a similar yokai known as the okuri itachi. This is a weasel that works in roughly the same way as the okuri inu, only that if you take off one of your shoes and throw it at it, the weasel will eat the shoe and run away, leaving you in peace.","Superstition related to the okuri inu are extremely old, and are found in all parts of Japan.

They were sold and used as good luck charms and as wards against evil spirits, disease, and other yokai. Because the hakutaku knows all, it was believed that evil yokai would stay away from him.","A legend from Toyama prefecture tells of a Japanese sighting of a hakutaku. It appeared on Mount Tateyama, one of the tallest and holiest mountains in Japan. This creature, called a kutabe in this legend, warned of a deadly plague that would soon sweep through the lands.

The two spoke, and the hakutaku told the emperor that in all of creation there were 11,520 different kinds of yokai. The emperor had his subordinates record everything the hakutaku said, and it was preserved in a volume known as the Hakutaku-zu.

The victim’s body is still paralyzed in sleep, but the eyes are open and the mind is half-awake; and the real and dream worlds mix together. Stories about kanashibari go back all the way to ancient times, and it was attributed to a supernatural force enacted upon the body. There are a number of legends about kanashibari, and each one points at a different cause.",,,"Other kinds of yokai can inflict kanashibari. The makura-gaeshi, a kind of zashiki-warashi from Ishikawa prefecture, haunts rooms at night, flipping over the pillows of the sleeping inhabitants. Victims sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, feeling a crushing weight on their chest, and find the ghost of a small child sitting on them. This can occur sporadically, or even every night, depending on the mood of the makura-gaeshi. Though not actually harmful, this is a terrifying experience for the victim.
Kanashibari can even be caused by humans — usually priests or sorcerers. The tale of Kiyohime features one passage where the jealous princess is chasing after her lover, Anchin. Trying to escape her advances, Anchin asks the priest at a Kumano shrine for help, and they are able to trap Kiyohime in kanashibari, giving Anchin time to flee.
Finally, kanashibari can be caused by ghosts. A famous account comes from a popular ghost story in Iwate prefecture. There are many variations, but generally what happens is this: during the middle of the night, a person wakes up with an ominous, foreboding sense of dread. He (or she) realizes that he can’t move, even though he is wide awake. It feels like powerful arms are gripping him tight, keeping him immobile. Suddenly, an invisible force tugs on his legs and drags him out from under his futon — usually in the direction of an open window, or a river, or some other dangerous place! After a desperate struggle, he finally snaps out of the sleep paralysis, and sees the ghost of a middle aged woman rising up into the ceiling.","The most common form of kanashibari comes from possession. When a person is possessed by inugami, kitsune, tanuki, or other kinds of tsukimono, one of the possible symptoms they can develop is immobility or sleep paralysis. This sort of possession could sometimes be overcome if a shugenja — a kind of priest — recited Buddhist sutras to drive out the possessing animal spirit.

There are many stories about how he came to be, but most of them say that he was originally a human boy who was born over a thousand years ago either in present-day Shiga or Toyama. His mother was a human woman and his father was the great dragon Yamata-no-Orochi. How he changed from boy to demon varies greatly from story to story, but the one popular version goes like this: There was a young boy who was supernaturally strong and abnormally intelligent for his age. Everyone around him constantly called him a demon child due to his incredible strength and wit, and he gradually became terribly anti-social and resentful of others. At age six, even his own mother abandoned him. Orphaned, he became an apprentice priest at Mt. Hiei in Kyoto. Naturally, he was the strongest and smartest of the young acolytes, and he grew resentful of them as well. He slacked off on his studies as a result and got into fights. He also fell into drinking, which was forbidden to monks; however he could out-drink anyone and everyone who was willing to sit down and drink against him. Because of his fondness for alcohol, he became known as Shuten dōji, “the little drunkard.”
One night there was a festival at the temple, and Shuten dōji showed up very drunk. He put on an oni mask and went around playing pranks on his fellow priests, jumping out from the darkness to scare them and such. At the end of the night, he tried to take off his mask but found he couldn’t — to his horror, it had fused to his body! Ashamed, scared, and scolded by his masters for being drunk, he fled into the mountains where he would no longer have to interact with other humans, whom he saw as weak, foolish, and hypocritical. He lived there on the outskirts of Kyoto for many years, stealing food and alcohol from villagers, and drinking vast quantities of alcohol. His banditry eventually attracted groups of thieves and criminals, who stuck with him loyally and became the foundation for his gang.
Living in exile, Shuten dōji grew in power and knowledge. He mastered strange, dark magic, and taught it to his thugs. He met another demon child like him, named Ibaraki dōji, who became his chief servant. Over time, the young man and his gang gradually transformed into oni, and eventually he had a whole clan of oni and yokai thugs who prowled the highways, terrorizing the people of Kyoto in a drunken rage. He and his gang eventually settled on Mount Ōe, where, in a dark castle, he plotted to conquer the capital and rule as emperor.
Shuten dōji and his gang rampaged through Kyoto, capturing noble virgins, drinking their blood and eating their organs raw. Finally, a band of heroes led by the legendary warrior Minamoto no Yorimitsu assaulted Shuten dōji’s palace, and with the help of some magical poison, were able to assault the oni band during a bout of heavy drinking. They cut off the drunken Shuten dōji’s head, but even after cutting it off, the head continued to bite at Minamoto no Yorimitsu.
Because the head belonged to an oni and was unholy, it was buried it outside of the city limits, at a mountain pass called Oinosaka.

Long ago, a wealthy noble couple had a daughter whom they loved very much. However, their daughter was sickly, and by the age of five she had still never spoken a single word. The worried couple consulted with priests and doctors, until finally one doctor told them that the only way to cure their daughter was to feed her a fresh liver from an unborn fetus.
The couple summoned their daughter’s nanny and put the task of retrieving the liver to her. Expecting that it would take some time to find someone willing to give up their baby’s liver, the nanny prepared for a long journey. She gave the daughter a protection charm and promised not to return without the liver, then left.
The nanny traveled for days, months, and eventually years without finding any family willing to give up their baby’s life. Eventually, her travels brought her to the moors of Adachigahara, in Fukushima. Despondent, she decided that if nobody would give her a liver, she would have to take one. She made camp in a cave off of the toad and decided to wait for a pregnant woman to pass by.
Many more years passed, and finally a lone pregnant woman came walking by on the road. The nanny leaped out of the cave and slew the traveler with her knife, carving her belly open, killing the fetus, and taking its fresh liver. Only after the deed was done, the nanny looked down at her victim, and noticed the young woman was wearing a very old but very familiar protection charm: the very same one that she had given the daughter so many years ago! The knowledge of what she had done weighed so heavily on her that the nanny went insane, and transformed into a yokai.
The demon of Adachigahara developed fearsome magical powers. She learned to lure travelers into her shelter and invite them to spend the night, after which she would murder them in their sleep. She remained there on the moors of Adachigahara for many many years, murdering any lone travelers who passed by her cave and eating their remains.
In the noh version of her story, the demon woman is eventually visited by traveling Buddhist priests, whom she plans to kill. While she is out gathering firewood, the priests find a room full of dead bodies and bones, and they recognize her as the Demon of Adachigahara. She chases after them, but they are able to hold her back with their Buddhist prayers, and drive the evil spirit from her, banishing it forever. When the demon spirit is driven from her body, she becomes an old woman and dies.

Watanabe no Tsuna, having just returned from a great battle with Shuten dōji’s clan, could not believe that there were any oni left, and single-handedly went out to investigate. He mounted his horse and went south.
When Tsuna arrived at the gate, a great howling wind broke out and his horse could travel no further. He dismounted and went on foot. Approaching the gate in the fierce gale, he noticed an enormous hand suddenly reach out of the dark to grab his helmet. Tsuna wasted no time, and swung his great katana around, severing the arm of an enormous demon: it was Ibaraki dōji, coming to avenge the murder of Shuten dōji. The injured demon ran away, leaving her arm behind, and Rashōmon was no longer haunted.

She was the chief deputy to Shuten dōji, the greated oni of all. Not very much is known about Ibaraki dōji’s life; it isn’t even known if Ibaraki dōji was male or female. Most stories and illustrations depict Ibaraki dōji as a kijo, or a female oni; yet there are other stories which refer to Shuten dōji’s deputy as a male. There is also a possibility that not only were the two partners in crime, but also lovers. What is known is that Ibaraki dōji was a wholly terrible and fearsome monster, bent of wreaking as much havoc in the human world as possible.","Ibaraki dōji’s most famous story takes place at Rashōmon, the southern gate of old Kyotos city walls. Rashōmon was built in 789, but after the Heian period it fell into serious disrepair and became known as an unsavory place. It was overgrown and unkempt. Thieves and bandits hung out near it. It even served as a dumping point for unwanted babies, and a spot to dispose of murder victims. But the scariest part of its haunted reputation was the legend of Rashōmon no oni — the demon of Rashōmon.",,

It takes the form of a human ghost, and haunts fishermen and others who stray too close to its home in the canals. Its name derives from a slang version of the phrase, “oite ike!” meaning, “drop it and get out of here!”",,,"One night, two fishermen were fishing in a particular spot in Honjo at sunset. They noticed that they were catching many more fish than usual, and so they fished and fished, filling their baskets to the brim. After some time, when they could hold no more fish, they happily packed up their tackle and prepared to carry their large catches home. Just as they were about to leave, they heard an eerie, terrible voice come up from the canal: “Oiteke!”
What happens next depends on who is telling the story. Some say that both fishermen dropped their baskets and fled, and when they returned later that night, both baskets were empty. Others say that they fled home with their baskets, but when they got home and looked inside, there wasn’t even a single fish in the baskets. But the most chilling version goes like this:
Both fisherman turned and fled from the canal, one of them dropping his basket and the other taking his basket with him. The fisherman who dropped his basket ran all the way back to his house and bolted the door shut. The other fisherman didn’t get very far — a ghostly hand rose up out of the canal and dragged him down into the water, basket and all. And he was never seen again.","Nobody really knows exactly what oitekebori was. The most likely explanation is that a kappa was responsible. Hungry and too lazy to fish on his own, he terrorized some innocent fishermen and stole their catch. Other explanations blame a tricky tanuki. Still other explanations exist, covering everything from a yūrei, a kawauso, a mujina, or a suppon (a soft-shelled turtle-turned-yokai).","Long ago, Honjo was full of canals and waterways, and those canals were teaming with fish. It was common for people to make their living catching and selling fish caught in the moat system.",,

It was thought that when a turban snail reaches 30 years old, it would turn into a yokai with all kinds of magical powers. Another way that sazae oni come to be is when a lustful young woman is thrown into the sea. Such a woman would transform into a sea snail, and if she happens to live a very long time she will transform into a sazae oni as well.","On the Kii penninsula, legend tells of a band of pirates who spotted a woman drowning in the water one night. They rescued her, though not out of the goodness in their hearts; they had more nefarious reasons to wanting a woman aboard their ship. That night every pirate on the ship had their way with her. Unfortunately for the pirates, the woman was actually a shape-changed sazae oni, and during the night, she visited each pirate on the boat one by one and bit off their testicles. At the end of the night she had all of their testicles, and demanded treasure for their return.

Koremochi and his retainers climbed the beautiful mountain, and they came upon a small group of aristocrats having a leaf-viewing party. Koremochi sent one of his retainer ahead to investigate. The retainer approached to inquire about the party, and was told that a noble princess was hosting it; however the ladies in waiting would not tell him the princess’ name. Just as Koremochi and his retainers decided to continue on their mission, one of the ladies-in-waiting approached and told them that her mistress had heard of Koremochi before, and she wanted to invite them to her party. Despite his mission Koremochi could not rudely turn down a princess, so he and his companions agreed.
At the party, the warriors were introduced to Princess Sarashina, an extremely beautiful young woman. They all sat and enjoyed watching the leaves, drinking sake, and dancing. Koremochi asked the princess if she would dance for him, and she did. Soon the men became drunk and sleepy, and dozed off under the beautiful trees.
As he slept, Koremochi dreamed of Hachiman and his mission. The god told him that Princess Sarashina was actually the kijo Momiji in disguise, and that he must kill her with the holy katana, Kogarasumaru (“Little Crow”). When Koremochi woke up, the sword he dreamed of was in his hand — a gift from Hachiman — and he knew that what he dreamed had been real. He chased after the women, and all of a sudden a huge firestorm broke out. Flame and wind lit up the mountain. Suddenly a ten foot tall kijo with horns made of burning trees appeared, and an intense battle between the samurai and the demoness took place. In the end, thanks to his magical sword, Koremochi was successful, and slew the Witch of Togakushi Mountain.","The tale of Princess Sarashina/Momiji is famous in Japanese theater. The noh play Momijigari (“Hunting Momiji” or “Fall-Leaf Hunting”) first appeared hundreds of years ago, during the Muromachi period. During the Meiji period it was remade as a kabuki play. Momijigari was made into a film in 1899, becoming the first narrative film in Japan. It was designated an Important Culture Property in 2009.","Long ago a powerful witch named Momiji lived in the mountains of Nagano prefecture.

In some literature the two yokai are used interchangeably for each other, therefore it has been suggested that tōfu kozō may be closely related to, or may even have been copied from hitotsume kozō. However, there is not enough evidence either way to say where this yokai comes from.","Prior to the Edo period there are no known stories about tōfu kozō, and so their origin is a mystery. Some say that they are just one of many forms taken by an itachi, a shape-shifting weasel yokai. Others say that they are the offspring of a mikoshi-nyūdō and a rokuro-kubi. Another possibility is that they are an invention of a creative artist looking to sell illustrated storybooks. Stories of tōfu kozō first appeared in the penny-novels and pulp fiction of Edo in the 1770’s, and became incredibly popular among the Edo upper class.

In times of war, residents will beseech their local hashihime to guard the bridge against invaders. In times of peace, hashihime are goddess of separation and severing, and are asked to aid people in things such as break-ups, divorce, and severing bad luck. So strong is their power of severing that it is considered taboo for lovers to pass in front of a hashihime shrine together, or for wedding processions to pass in front of one. If newlyweds need to cross a bridge inhabited by a hashihime, they will instead pass underneath it on a boat rather than risk cursing their marriage.
A woman visited the the Kifune-jinja in Kyoto at the hour of the ox (roughly 2 am), filled with rage and jealousy towards her ex-husband who had thrown her away for another woman. Night after night she visited the shrine, praying to the gods enshrined there to turn her into a powerful demon. The woman wanted nothing else other than to see her ex-husband destroyed, even at the cost of her own life. After seven nights of pilgrimage, her prayers were answered: the gods told her that if she immersed herself in the Uji river for twenty-one nights, she would become a living demon.
The woman did as she was bid. She donned a white robe and tied her hair up into five horns. She painted her face and covered her body in crimson dye. She placed an upturned trivet on her head and attached torches to each foot. She lit a torch on both ends and placed it in her mouth. She immersed herself in the Uji river and for twenty-one days she kindled the hatred in her heart. Then, just as the gods told her, after twenty-one days she transformed into a terrible kijo with supreme power. She had become the hashihime of Uji.
That night, her husband awoke from a horrible dream with a premonition of danger. He quickly sought out the famous onmyōji, Abe-no-Seimei. Seimei recognized the dream as a sign that the man’s former wife would come and destroy the couple that very night, and promised to save them. He went to their house, recited magical prayers, and crafted two katashiro — magical paper doll representations of the man and his wife, meant to be used as substitutionary targets for the kijo’s rage. That night, as Seimei had predicted, the demon appeared. She attacked the two katashiro instead of the real couple, and Seimei’s magic worked: her power was reflected back upon her and she was driven away. The demon woman, realizing that she could not overcome Abe-no-Seimei’s magic, vanished, threatening that she would come back  another time.",,"The most famous hashihime story comes from Tsurugi no Maki, in The Tale of the Heike, and is retold in the noh play Kanawa.",,

They rarely appear before humans, but their tracks are easily recognizable. They leave deep, sunken footprints about 12 inches long every 6 to 7 feet (from their hopping about on one leg).

They are most well known, however, for their powerful voices. The cry of a yamajijii is so powerful it blows the leaves off of branches, splits trees and moves rocks, reverberates through the mountains, and shakes the heavens and the earth.

In some versions of the tale, the clever hunter prepares for the shouting contest by praying to the gods of Ise and crafting a special holy bullet inscribed with their names. This bullet had a very special power: when fired it would never miss its target.

The grateful Emperor promised to give the abbot anything he wished in return for his prayers. Raigō asked that a splendid new ordination building be constructed at Mii-dera so he could train new priests. The Emperor gladly agreed, however Mii-dera had a powerful rival temple — Enryaku-ji, on top of Mt. Hiei — which wielded great political power as well as having a powerful army of warrior monks at its disposal. Enryaku-ji could not abide such a gift being granted to a rival temple, and so it exerted its great pressure on the Emperor. Bowing to Enryaku-ji, the Emperor reneged on his promise to Raigō.
Raigō began a hunger strike in protest of the Emperor’s broken promise, but the Emperor would not, or could not, go against Enryaku-ji’s will. On the 100th day of his hunger strike, Raigō passed away, his heart full of rage towards the unfaithful Emperor and the rival monastery of Enryaku-ji. So great was the hatred in Raigō’s heart when he died that he transformed into an onryō, a ghost driven by pure vengeance. Shortly after Raigō’s death, a ghostly vision of the abbot was seen hovering near young Prince Taruhito’s bed. A few days later the young prince died, leaving the Emperor heir-less once again. But Raigo’s vengeance did not end there.
Raigō’s twisted spirit transformed into a gigantic rat. Its body was as hard as stone and its teeth and claws as strong as iron.

They devoured Enryaku-ji’s precious sutras, scrolls, and books, eating and despoiling everything they found — they even ate the precious statues of the Buddha.
Nothing could stop Tesso and the army of rats until finally a shrine was built at Mii-dera to appease Raigō’s spirit, and Raigō’s shrine still stands at Mii-dera today.

Emperor Yōmei died in 587, after which the Mononobe clan and Soga clan tried their best to influence the succession of the imperial title.

The loss of his precious golden chicken caused Tatsugorō so much grief that he died, and because of the unhappy circumstances of his death, his ghost was unable to pass on.
Normally, when a ghost lingers like this, it attaches itself to the object of its desire, be it a person, a place, or (in this case) a thing. Tatsugorō’s soul meant to attach itself to his precious kogane no niwatori. In Japanese, the words for “gong” and “golden” can both be read “kane.” Poor Tatsugorō’s ghost must have gotten confused and attached itself to a nearby shōgo instead of his chicken, and the instrument turn into a tsukumogami.","The name shogorō is a pun. It is a combination of shōgo, the gong, and gorō, a very common part of a boy’s name. The word can also be read as a combination of shōgo and goryō (御霊), the ghost of a noble or an aristocrat from ages past. Goryō are a grade of ghost above yūrei, and play a large part in many Japanese ghost stories.","In the early 18th century, there was a wealthy merchant family called Yodoya living in Osaka. For many generations, the Yodoya were the kings of the rice trade, raking in unbelievable amounts of cash. The 5th generation boss, Yodoya Tatsugorō, had so much money and lived a life of such extreme opulence that he attracted the attention of the bakufu (regional shogunate officials, something like military police).",,

Furaru-bi is one of these lost souls.,"In the late 16th century, Toyama was ruled by a samurai named Sassa Narimasa. Narimasa kept a very beautiful concubine named Sayuri in his household. Sayuri was not well liked by the female servants and other women in Sassa Narimasa’s household. They were jealous of her beauty and of Narimasa’s love for her. One day, these women conspired against Sayuri and started a rumor that she had been unfaithful to Narimasa with one of his own men. Narimasa flew in a fit of jealous rage, murdered Sayuri, then took her body down to the Jinzū river. He hung her corpse from a tree and proceeded to carve it into pieces with his sword.

However, they reveal their true forms during funeral services, when they leap down from rooftops to snatch corpses out of their coffins. Kasha are occasionally employed as messengers or servants of hell, in which case they are tasked with collecting the corpses of wicked humans spiriting them off to hell for punishment. Other times, they steal corpses for their own uses — either to animate as puppets or to eat.","It is nearly impossible to retrieve a person’s remains after they have been snatched by a kasha. This makes passing on to the next life difficult. The best defense is to be prepared; temples in areas where kasha are said to prowl have devised unique ways of defending against these monster cats. In Yamagata, clever priests have taken to holding two funeral ceremonies for the deceased. The first ceremony is a fake — the casket is filled only with rocks, so if a kasha comes for the body it will end up with nothing. The real ceremony takes place afterwards, when the risk of a kasha encounter is lessened. In Ehime, a head shaving razor may be placed on top of the coffin as against kasha. In Miyazaki, priests chant, “baku ni wa kuwasen” and “kasha ni wa kuwasen” (“don’t be eaten by a baku, don’t be eaten by a kasha”) twice times in front of the funeral procession in order to keeps evil spirits away. In Okayama, the priests play a myōhachi — a type of cymbal used in religious ceremonies — in order to keep the kasha away.","Kasha were once ordinary house cats. Like other animals, as they age in years and their tails grow longer, cats begin to develop magical powers.

Satori are most well known for their uncanny ability to read people’s minds and then speak their thoughts faster than the individuals can get the words out themselves. This makes it very difficult to hunt, trick, or escape from a hungry satori. However, should something unforeseen happen, such as being unexpectedly hit by an object, satori grow very frightened and run away. One of the only ways to avoid being eaten by one of these yokai is to completely empty one’s mind; with no mind to read, the satori grows bored and wanders away.","The origin of the satori is not entirely clear. Edo-period encyclopedias relate satori with yamako, apes from western China and captures women to rape or to eat. It has also been theorized that satori are cousins of yamabiko, a small monkey-like yokai. The satori’s ability to read people’s minds and the yamabiko’s ability to mimic their words are rooted in the same folklore. More recent folklorists have suggested that satori are fallen mountain gods of the ancient proto-Shinto religion which have been corrupted into yokai over the ages.","The name satori literally means “enlightenment” in the Buddhist sense. The satori, with its uncanny ability to read thoughts, comes across as a kind of enlightened being to scared travelers, which is how it got its name.

However, sometimes support pillars are actually installed this way on purpose. The reason for this is another folk belief: “The moment a house is completed, it starts to fall apart.” As a kind of ward against bad luck, Japanese buildings were sometimes only almost completed, with the final step being left out, or purposefully made into a mistake. The famous Tosho-gu shrine at Nikko is such an example, having been built with just one pillar purposefully pointing in the opposite direction.

They appear just as the living person from which they spawn; sometimes they take on a ghostly, translucent form, while other times they are indistinguishable from a living person.",,"There are a number of common ways for ikiryō to appear: during a near-death-experience, fainting, intense passion or desire, intense hatred, or even as part of a curse. Ikiryō most commonly appear due to some intense emotion or trauma, and the owner of the soul is almost always unaware of the ikiryō’s existence. This can lead to some very awkward situations and misunderstandings.","Folk superstitions about ikiryō go back to before recorded history. According to ancient superstition, just before death the soul leaves the body and is able to walk around, making strange noises and doing other things outside of the body. This is especially common during wartime, and the ikiryō of soldiers even in far off lands are said to appear to their friends and loved ones moments before or after their deaths, in their war uniforms, to give one last goodbye. The souls of the soon-to-die and recently-deceased are also sometimes seen visiting nearby temples and praying for a few days after their deaths.
During the Heian period, ikiryō were a popular subject of stories. They were sometimes attributed to intense feelings of love. When a person (usually a woman) felt such intense passion and love, her spirit would detach from her body and haunt the object of her affection, whispering sweet things into his ears. Depending on the strength of her feelings, the ikiryō could even physically move her lover around. This was not romantic, however — people haunted in this way were often tormented to the point of extreme sickness by these ghosts.
The most common form on ikiryō is one born of rage and vengeance. Just as the ghosts of the dead can go after those who wrong them in life, an ikiryō can manifest from one living person to curse another. These are also usually unconscious manifestations, however a few famous examples of conscious manifestations of ikiryō curses exist. The pilgrimage of the hour of the ox (ushi no koku mairi) and ichijama (from Okinawa) are ceremonial curses in which a person consciously sends their soul from their body to hurt or to kill their enemies. Of course, this sort of black magic often has dire consequences for the performer as well as the target.
During the Edo period, ikiryō were considered a symptom of certain illnesses, such as the aptly-named rikonbyō, or “detached soul syndrome,” and kage no yamai, or “shadow illness.” These horrifyingly-named diseases were Edo period terms for sleepwalking and out-of-body experiences. For carriers of these illnesses, it was said that the soul could depart from the body at night, taking the person’s consciousness along with it. This would cause them to experience things from the ikiryō’s perspective as if they were actually doing it. A person might have false memories of things he didn’t do, or be accused of things he didn’t remember. Some people even experienced meeting their own selves, as if they had a doppelganger.
Superstitions about ikiryō have persisted into modern times, particularly those dealing with people appearing to family members and friends on or around the times of their deaths. The idea of the soul leaving the body and experiencing things during out of body experiences persists as well, and remains an unexplained phenomenon.",,,,

In this story, there was a young girl who lived together with her father. After her father died, his shiryō appeared before the young girl and tried to take her with him into the world of the dead. The girl narrowly escaped and fled from the house to ask for help. Every night, various friends and distant family members agreed to stay overnight in the house with her and watch over her, and every night without fail, her father’s shiryō came looking for her, to try to take her away.

Momonjii appear late at night on the road, when the wind blows strongly, and those who meet them suddenly become very sick.",,,"During the Edo period, there was a strict prohibition on eating meat from certain animals such as deer and boar. These forbidden animals were collectively referred to as momonjii. To get around this prohibition, shops began selling animal meat as “medicine” instead of food. These “medicine” shops were called momonji-ya, and the meat sold there was believed to ward off disease. The fact that this yokai resembles a wild animal and also brings disease is an ironic reference to momonjii and momonji-ya.
The “medicine” sold at momonji-ya was given nicknames in order to disguise its true contents. For instance, deer meat was called momiji, or maple leaves, and boar meat was referred to as botan, or peony. This secret imagery persists in things like hanafuda playing cards, where deer and maple leaves, and boar and peonies, are depicted together. When Toriyama Sekien, who was very aware of the imagery in hanafuda cards, first illustrated the momonjii, he drew him hiding in a pile of maple leaves — creating yet another connected between this yokai and the prohibition of animal meat.","The name momonjii was created by a very complicated combination of Japanese puns and wordplay. It is formed from the words momonga and gagoji. Momonga is the Japanese word for a small flying squirrel, but long ago the momonga and musasabi (the Japanese giant flying squirrel) were thought to be the same animal, so their names were used interchangeably. The yokai nobusuma (from which momonjii are created) very closely resembles a musasabi, and so the interchangeable name momonga was often used to refer to the nobusuma. Gagoji is a regional word that refers to a bogeyman-like monster who assaults children. The word comes from the legend of Gagoze, the demon of Gangō-ji; being a regional variation of the demon’s name. Thus, momonga and gagoji were combined to form momonjii, referring to a scary child-assaulting monster which is related to the nobusuma.",,,

While it is laughing and blinded by its own lips, it can be taken down by striking it in the middle of the forehead with a sharp spike.","Hihi are sometimes confused with other monkey-like yokai that live in the mountains, such as yamawaro and satori.

Because of these behaviors, they are especially troublesome, and so special methods have been invented to prevent such disturbances to the deceased.","Mōryō are afraid of oak trees and tigers. As a result of this, in ancient China it was common to plant oak trees in graveyards, and to adorn the roads leading into and out of graveyards with stone tigers. Additionally, prior to interring a casket in the ground, a servant would enter the grave hold and prod around with a spear to make sure no mōryō were hiding in the grave.

A few days later, a disaster befell the temple. This happened again and again, and soon the priests at the temple realized that the tsubaki would cry a warning every time something bad was going to happen. The tree was dubbed Yonaki Tsubaki, or “night-crying tsubaki,” and still stands today in the temple Kanman-ji, where it has stood for over 700 years.
In Ōgaki, Gifu, there is an ancient burial mound. One year, historians excavated the burial mound and discovered some ancient artifacts, including a mirror and some bones; however, shortly after the man who discovered the artifacts died.

Money was also sometimes referred to as oashi, or “feet,” because it comes and goes as if it had its own feet.
The phrase ashi ga tsuku is a common idiom which means “to catch someone who has committed a crime.” Very clever readers would have noticed that if the word ashi, which can also mean money, is replaced with chōmoku, which can also mean money, the phrase changes to mean “covered in bird eyes.”
Hidesato reached the horse graveyard and waited until nightfall. When the hour of the ox came, an enormous demon appeared and ravenously began devouring horse carcasses. The demon stood over ten feet tall, had sharp, spiked hair, and was covered in glowing eyes all over its body. Hidesato carefully aimed an arrow at the brightest glowing eyeball and fired. The arrow hit its mark, and the demon roared in pain, fleeing into the woods until it finally collapsed at the foot of Mount Myōjin.
The battle was not over, for although the demon was near-fatally wounded, it still had power left. From its body erupted a torrent of flame. Its mouth split open and poisonous fumes spewed forth. The toxic air and intense heat proved too much for Fujiwara no Hidesato, who had to give up and return to his palace. When Hidesato returned the next day, the ground was blackened and burnt over a large area, but there was no sign of the demon.
400 years later, during the Muromachi period, the dodomeki finally reappeared. A village had sprung up on the northern slope of Mount Myōjin, and strange things had begun happening. The temple’s head priest had been suffering mysterious injuries and unexplained fires began to break out at the temple. A new head priest, the virtuous and holy Saint Chitoku, was called to discover what the cause of the strange problems was.
Saint Chitoku noticed that one young woman stopped by the temple frequently whenever he preached his sermons, and recognized it as the dodomeki in disguise. The demon, terribly wounded, had retreated into some caves nearby to heal. It transformed into a young woman, and had been visiting the site where it fell, gradually sucking back up all of the noxious fumes that it had breathed out, and collecting all of the blood that it had bled in the battle with Fujiwara no Hidesato. The village temple had been built on top of the battle site, and the dodomeki caused the fires and attacked the priest to scare them away.
One day, Saint Chitoku confronted the demon in disguise, and she finally revealed her true form was a dodomeki. She did not attack him, however; while frequenting the temple, she had overheard Chitoku’s powerful sermons, and they had stuck with her. The dodomeki promised that she would never again commit any act of evil.

No matter how much food was laid out, the sparrow would devour every grain of rice, leaving nothing for the palace inhabitants.
It was not long before the court began to grow very scared of this bird. It began to destroy all of the crops in the fields, and nobody knew how to stop the sparrow’s attacks.Rumors began to spread that the sparrow could only be the vengeful ghost, or onryō, of Fujiwara no Sanekata, desperate to return and take revenge upon the imperial court.
At the same time, the high priest of Kangaku-in, Saint Kanshi, had a sparrow visit him in a dream. The sparrow identified itself as the spirit of Sanekata, desperately longing to return to his beloved Kyoto, and asked the priest to chant and pray for him. The next morning, Kanshi discovered the body of a single sparrow lying dead at the base of a tree on the temple grounds. He recognized the sparrow as the transformed spirit of Fujiwara no Sanekata, and built a small grave for the sparrow, mourning it and praying for its soul.

Namanari hannya are kijo that still resemble human women. They have small horns and use dark magic to perform their evil deeds, such as summoning ikiryō to attack their enemies. They are not completely evil; there remains a chance for these beginner demons to return to humanity. Chūnari hannya are mid-level demons. They have long, sharp horns, tusk-like fangs, and more powerful magic. However, they are still vulnerable to Buddhist prayers. Honnari hannya are true demons and the most powerful of the three. They have serpentine bodies and breathe fire. Honnari hannya have embraced their jealousy so deeply that there is no calming their fury.

In the play Aoi no Ue, a shugenja (an ascetic mystic) exorcises the spirit of the hannya Lady Rokujō from Lady Aoi. As it is driven away, the evil spirit cries out, “Oh, how horrible!

On his return, he avoided the Masago no Shōji manor and headed straight for Mutsu.
When Kiyo hime heard of Anchin’s deception, she was overcome with grief. She ran after the young priest, barefoot, determined to marry him. Anchin fled as fast as he could, but Kiyo hime caught him on the road to the temple Dōjō-ji. There, instead of greeting her, Anchin lied again. He pretended not to know her and protested that he was late for a meeting somewhere else. Kiyo hime’s sadness turned into furious rage. She attacked, moving to punish the lying priest. Anchin prayed to Kumano Gongen to save him. A divine light dazzled Kiyo hime’s eyes and paralyzed her body, giving Anchin just enough time to escape.
Kiyo hime’s rage exploded to its limits—the divine intervention had pushed her over the edge. She transformed into a giant, fire-breathing serpent. When Anchin reached the Hidaka River, he paid the boatman and begged him not to allow his pursuer to cross. Then, he ran to Dojō-ji for safety. Ignoring the boatman entirely, Kiyo hime swam across the river after Anchin.
Seeing the monstrous serpent, the priests of Dōjō-ji hid Anchin inside of the large, bronze temple bell. However, Kiyo hime could smell Anchin inside. Overcome with rage and despair, she wrapped herself around the bell and breathed fire until the bronze became white hot. She roasted Anchin alive inside the bell.

The novel revolves around the life of Hikaru Genji, a noble living in the height of the Heian period.

Her name comes from Rokujō, the area of Kyoto in which she lived.",,,"The widowed Lady Rokujō soon became one of the mistresses of an aspiring nobleman named Hikaru Genji. She fell deeply in love with him. But because of her age, rank, beauty, and refinement, Genji was reluctant to return her affections. Lady Rokujō also could not express her true feelings as she wished without breaking court decorum. Instead, she repressed her feelings of jealousy, which began to transform her into a demon.
One night, while sightseeing during the Hollyhock Festival, Lady Rokujō’s carriage collided with the carriage belonging to Genji’s rightful wife Lady Aoi. After already losing her place to Genji’s wife, Lady Rokujō discovered that Lady Aoi was pregnant with Genji’s child. The insult was too much. Her repressed jealousy escaped from her body and transformed into an ikiryō, which haunted Lady Aoi every night. Eventually, the ikiryō was witnessed by Genji, who purchased herbal charms for his wife to protect her against evil spirits.
Lady Aoi gave birth to Genji’s son, but shortly afterwards became possessed by Lady Rokujō’s vengeful spirit. (This possession is the subject of the noh play Aoi no Ue.) The ikiryō was finally exorcised by a shugenja, but the possession took its tool of Lady Aoi and she passed away.
Lady Rokujō had hoped to become Genji’s next wife, but she discovered that her own hair and clothes carried the odor of Genji’s herbal charms. She realized that she had been responsible for the hauntings. Thinking that Genji could never love her after murdering his wife, Lady Rokujō left the capital and joined her daughter at the Ise Shrine.
Six years later, Lady Rokujō returned to Kyoto with her daughter and became a nun. Shortly afterwards, she fell very ill. Genji came to visit her, and was stricken with her daughter. Lady Rokujō, still deeply in love with Genji, begged him not to take her daughter as a lover. Lady Rokujō passed away, and Genji adopted her daughter as his ward. They moved into her old villa at Rokujō.
Even in death, Lady Rokujō’s jealousy remained as a vengeful shiryō, which appeared at the Rokujō villa. It haunted Genji, attacking his new wife Lady Murasaki and the other ladies of the house. Upon hearing of the hauntings, Lady Rokujō’s daughter became sad that her mother had still not found peace in death.

He is responsible for making your eyes grow weak, creating wrinkles, and growing white hairs. Chūshi lives in your torso and looks like a wild beast. He is responsible for damaging internal organs, making you overeat and overdrink, and causing bad dreams. Geshi lives in the lower half of your body and looks like a human foot with a cow’s head. He drains the will and shortens the life of his host.
The number 60 is an important number in Chinese astrology, and every sixty days the sanshi leave the body to visit the King of Heaven while their host human sleeps. They report their host’s wicked deeds for the year to king. Depending on this report, the King of Heaven shortens each human’s life span by a certain amount.
To escape the King of Heaven’s sentence, Kōshin practitioners do not sleep every 60th night, so the sanshi are never able to leave the body and give their report. Additionally, spells and charms are chanted to prevent any harm done by the sanshi. The following spell is said to defeat the sanshi’s power:

Enraged, she grabbed the nearest kamuro and poured the entire pot of boiling liquid down the little girl’s throat. The girl, vomiting up her insides, smeared her bloody handprints along the wall as she died in anguish. Ever since, it was said that the voice of that young kamuro could be heard at night, calling out for vengeance against the oiran.","The origins of this yōkai are vague. Ōkaburo are best known for their depiction by Toriyama Sekien. His ōkaburo is actually a male yōkai dressed up as a young kamuro, wearing a chrysanthemum-patterned kimono. His description makes an allusion to Peng Zu, a legendary Taoist wizard from China. Peng Zu lived past the age of 700 by having lots of sex with both women and men, and keeping a strict herbal diet which included licking the dew off of chrysanthemums. For this Peng Zu took the nickname Kiku-jidō, or chrysanthemum boy. Sekien likely intended his ōkaburo to be a pun referring to homosexual brothels in which young boys were dressed up as kamuro and offered to male patrons. Aside from the obvious connotations of having a young boy dressed up as a kamuro, the chrysanthemum was used as a secret symbol for homosexuality; the shape of the petals was supposed to represent an anus. The nickname chrysanthemum boy, the chrysanthemums on the kimono, and the image of licking the dew off of “chrysanthemums” leave little to the imagination as to what Sekien was alluding to with this yōkai.",,,

Her story became popular in the Edo period, and is depicted in novels, woodblock prints, and kabuki. The details of her story vary quite a bit from version to version.",,,"One day while exploring Mount Tsukuba, Yoshikado encountered a mysterious wizard named Nikushisen. Nikushisen informed Yoshikado that he was the heir of Taira no Masakado, and gave him a magic scroll containing the secrets of frog magic. Yoshikado returned to his sister, and told her everything Nikushisen had said. He gave her the scroll. She studied it and also became a master of frog magic, and took the name Takiyasha hime. The two of them decided to fulfill their father’s dream of overthrowing the emperor and ushering in a new order.
In a different version of the story, instead of Yoshikado meeting Nikushisen, Satsuki hime secretly began to perform the dreaded curse ushi no koku mairi—the shrine visit at the hour of the ox. Every night, she snuck into the Kifune Shrine and performed the ritual. After twenty-one nights, she awakened the aramitama—the violent, wicked spirit—of the Kifune Shrine. The aramitama spoke to her, granting her the knowledge of onmyōdō, and instructing her to take the name Takiyasha hime.
Takiyasha hime and Yoshikado returned to their father’s fortress of Sōma Castle in Shimosa province. They called on the surviving soldiers who remained loyal to their father’s cause. Using her newly acquired black magic, Takiyasha hime raised an army of yōkai to continue her father’s rebellion against the emperor.
Ōya no Tarō Mitsukuni, a warrior who was knowledgeable about onmyōdō, had heard of Takiyasha hime’s plans and set out to Sōma Castle to investigate if the rumors were true. When he arrived, Takiyasha hime disguised herself as a prostitute and tried to seduce Mitsukuni. However, Mitsukuni suspected a trap and told her about the brutal death of Taira no Masakado. Takiyasha hime could not contain her emotion, and she fled from Mitsukuni. That night, she ambushed him with an army of skeletons and yōkai. According to Utagawa Kuniyoshi’s famous ukiyoe print, Takiyasha hime unleashed a gashadokuro upon him—a gigantic skeleton as tall as a castle.
Riding into battle on top of a giant toad, Takiyasha hime assaulted the brave warrior Mitsukuni. In the end, despite her magic, she was defeated just as her father was. Her short rebellion was snuffed out just as his was.
Today, many statues of frogs decorate Taira no Masakado’s gravesite in Kubizuka. The Japanese word for frog, kaeru, is a homophone of the word meaning “return.” Masakado’s severed head longed to return to his hometown, and patrons hope that Masakado’s spirit will “kaeru,” return, to heaven—and not cause any more harm on Earth.

Two of Masakado’s children, Yoshikado and Satsuki hime, somehow managed to escape their execution. They remained in hiding at a temple at the base of Mount Tsukuba for years.

https://yokai.com/tairanomasakado/,Taira no Masakado,平将門,たいらのまさかど,,,,,"Taira no Masakado was a samurai of the Heian period, a powerful warrior, and a great leader. He was born either in the late 800s or early 900s CE and was killed in 940. After his death, his spirit is said to have returned as a vengeful ghost and brought destruction across the country. Along with Emperor Sutoku and Sugawara no Michizane, he is one of the Nihon San Dai Onryō—Three Great Onryō of Japan.",,,"Though Taira no Masakado’s birth date is unknown, he is believed to have been born sometime around when Sugawara no Michizane died. A Meiji period biography of Taira no Masakado suggests that he may have been Sugawara no Michizane’s reincarnation; his revolt against the emperor may actually have been a continuation of Michizane’s curse.
In 935 CE, the dispute with his family members broke into outright battle. Masakado was ambushed by one of his uncles and a number of Minamoto warriors. But Masakado was a powerful warrior. He quickly defeated them, and then took his revenge by burning their lands, ravaging the countryside, and slaughtering thousands. This brought him into conflict with other relatives by blood and by marriage, who brought their dispute to the emperor.
Taira no Masakado was summoned to court to answer charges of the relatives of the dead Minamoto warriors. Masakado was not only brave, he was also smart. He had taken great pains to remain within the law and proved that he had good reason for his killings. After only a few months, he was fully pardoned when the court offered a general amnesty in commemoration of Emperor Suzaku’s coming of age.
Taira no Masakado returned to his home, but soon found himself under attack. This time, it was his father-in-law and his relatives. Again, Masakado quickly defeated them. To avoid stirring up more political trouble, Masakado received a warrant to apprehend his attackers. Now, with legal sanction for his military action, he stormed into their lands on a quest for revenge.
In 938 CE, Taira no Masakado received another court summons for questioning about a quarrel with one of the cousins who had attacked him. This time, Masakado ignored the summons. He raised a large force and invaded Hitachi Province. He conquered eight provinces: Shimotsuke, Kozuke, Musashi, Kazusa, Awa, Sagami, Izu, and Shimosa. The whole time, he maintained his innocence, insisting that his campaign was legal under the terms of his warrant.
The government was seen as ineffectual and the nobles as abusive by the peasants of the time. Taira no Masakado, on the other hand, treated the peasants of his conquered domains much better than their former masters did. His insurrection was seen as a salvation by many peasants. They welcomed him gladly. The court feared that Taira no Masakado was preparing to overthrow the government and declare himself the new Emperor of Japan. He was condemned as a rebel and a traitor.
A number of warriors—including Masakado’s ally Fujiwara no Hidesato and some his own relatives—were commissioned by the government to take his head. They caught up with Masakado’s army in Shimosa province on the fourteenth day of the second month of 940 CE. They attacked during a night ambush and quickly defeated the rebels. Masakado’s men were outnumbered ten to one. Masakado was beheaded, betrayed by his friends and family. The head was brought back to Kyoto to be displayed in the east market as a message to would-be rebels.
One night the head began to glow. It flew off into the sky, across the country, towards Shimosa. The head eventually grew tired and landed to rest in a fishing village called Shibazaki (which would one day grow into the city of Edo). The villagers who found the head cleaned it and buried it. A shrine was erected over the grave and named Kubizuka—the mound of the head. Masakado was honored and worshipped by the peasants as a true warrior, a symbol of justice who stood in heroic defiance of a corrupt and lazy nobility. He was seen as an underdog who was repeatedly betrayed and eventually murdered by those he should have been able to trust. Despite his deification and popularity among the lower classes, his ghost was not appeased. A few years after his head was buried, the ghost of a samurai began to be seen in the neighborhood of his shrine.
In the early 1300s, a great plague struck Edo. Many people died. The plague was attributed to Taira no Masakado’s anger. In order to appease him, his spirit was moved from his small shrine to the larger and more prestigious Kanda Shrine. He was designated one of the main gods, and his spirit was placated—for a while. In 1874, Emperor Meiji visited the Kanda Shrine. It was viewed as inappropriate for an enemy of the imperial family like Masakado to be honored when the emperor was visiting, and so his deity status was revoked. His shrine was moved to a smaller building outside of the main shrine.
Taira no Masakado’s anger returned in 1928. After the Great Kanto Earthquake destroyed much of the city, the site of his Kubizuka was chosen as the temporary location for the Ministry of Finance. Shortly afterwards, the Minister of Finance became sick and died. Over a dozen other employees died, and even more became sick or were injured in falls and accidents in the building. Rumors about the curse ran began to spread. The Ministry of Finance building was demolished and a memorial service for Masakado was held at the Kanda Shrine.
Throughout the 20th century, a number of other accidents, fires, sicknesses, and mysterious sightings were attributed to the curse of Taira no Masakado. Each time, purification rituals were performed. Finally, in 1984, in response to public pressure, his deity status was reinstated. Today, great pains are taken not to anger his ghost. For example, it is common practice for television stations to visit the grave of his head, still located in what is now Otemachi, Tokyo. They pay their respects to him before his character appears on any show. The Kubizuka is maintained by an organization of local businesses and volunteers who have taken on the responsibility of upkeeping of his grave.","Taira no Masakado was born into the Kanmu Heishi, the clan of Taira descended from Emperor Kanmu. It was an elite family. Masakado had a privileged childhood in the capital, after which he settled down in Shimosa Province in Eastern Japan, northeast of modern day Tokyo. His troubles only began after his father died. Inheritance laws at this time were not firmly established, and his uncles tried to steal most of his father’s land. They claimed their royal lineage gave them the right to do so.","Strangely, Taira no Masakado’s head did not decompose. Many months after it was first displayed in the east market, it still looked as fresh as the day it was severed. The eyes had grown fiercer, and the mouth twisted up into a hideous grimace. Night after night the head would call out, “Where is my murdered body!? Come here! Reattach my head and let me fight once again!” And then things got really strange.",,

A kudan never lives for more than a few days.","Kudan are able to speak human languages from the day they are born. Immediately upon being born, a kudan gives one or more prophecies. The content of their prophecies varies. Some kudan have spoken of great harvests or terrible famines, some have foretold plagues and droughts, while others have predicted wars. The prediction of a kudan never fails to come true. Upon delivering its prophecy, a kudan immediately dies.",,"Kudan sightings continued through the end of the Edo period until after World War 2. Among some of the events supposedly predicted by kudan are the Russo-Japanese War and the Pacific War. Because of their uncanny ability to predict the future, the word of a kudan was viewed as absolute truth. During the Edo period, newspapers looking to add credibility to a story would include the words “kudan no gotoshi,” or, “as if a kudan had said it” to their articles. This phrase remains in use in the Japanese language today as a way of assuring the reader of the truth of a story.
Because of its reputation for honesty, images of kudan were used as talismans for good luck, prosperity, and protection from sickness and disaster. Newspapers advised their readers to hang the printed images of kudan on their houses for protection and good fortune. Kudan were such popular yokai that their mummified remains were often carted around in traveling sideshows. These “kudan” could be made of stillborn deformed calves, or of different animal parts stitched together to create a chimera-like stuffed animal. Visitors paid a small fee to gawk at these specimens and hopefully receive some of their good luck. A few of these mummified remains survive in museums today.","Kudan are a relatively recent yokai, having entered the public zeitgeist during the end of the Edo period. This was a period of great social and political upheaval. The fall of the shogunate and the return of imperial authority, combined with the rapid changes brought about by the opening of trade with the West were responsible for a lot of uncertainly and turmoil throughout Japan. During this time, stories of kudan being born popped up up in newspapers all across the country.",,,

They live in splendid coral palaces deep on the ocean floor. Wani have a complex political hierarchy which mirrors that of the surface world. There are kings and queens, princes and princess, courtesans, servants, and so on. Watatsumi, also known as Ryūjin, is the greatest of them. He rules the sea from his palace Ryūgū-jō. He controls the ebb and flow of the ocean using the tide jewels kanju and manju.",,"The word wani first appears in the Kojiki written with man’yōgana (an archaic phonetic syllabary). Later it came to be written with the kanji 鰐. Wani came to refer to sharks and other “sea monsters” that sailors and fishermen might encounter out at sea. The sea was a dangerous and mysterious place, and sailors may have thought that sharks were the powerful serpents of legends. Over time, the meaning of the word expanded to include to crocodiles as well as sharks, and then shifted to refer only to crocodiles. Today both the kanji and the name wani mean “crocodile” and are rarely used to refer to sea dragons.
Hoori and Toyotama hime were married, and they lived together at the bottom of the sea for three years. Eventually, Hoori became homesick and longed to see country again. Together, he and his wife returned to the surface world with Hoderi’s lost hook. While on land, Toyotami hime gave birth to a son. When she went into labor, she asked Hoori not to look upon her, because she had to change into her true form in order to bear her child. Hoori became curious and sneaked a peak at his wife while she gave birth. He was shocked to see, instead of his wife, a huge wani cradling their newborn son. The wani was, of course, Toyotama hime in her true form. Toyotama hime was unable to forgive his betrayal, and was so ashamed that she fled back into the ocean and never saw Hoori or her son again.
Although Toyotama hime abandoned her son, her sister Tamayori came to raise him in her absence. The boy, Ugayafukiaezu, grew up to marry Tamayori, and together they had a son. Their son was Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan.","Wani appear in the earliest written records of Japanese myths, the Kojiki and Nihon shoki. Their stories almost certainly date back even further, into the mists of prehistory. Scholars disagree over whether the earliest legends of wani originated in Japan or were imported from other cultures, citing similarities between wani and the Chinese long or the Indian naga. Wani play an important role in Japanese mythology, including in the mythological founding of Japan.","One of the most famous wani legends is the story of Toyotama hime, the daughter of Watatsumi. She married a surface dweller named Hoori. Hoori and his brother Hoderi were grandchildren of Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. One day Hoori borrowed and lost Hoderi’s fish hook. Hoderi insisted that Hoori find and return the lost hook, so Hoori went into the ocean to look for it. He was unable to find the hook, but instead he discovered the palace where the dragon king of the sea lived. Hoori visited the palace and asked Watatsumi for help finding the hook. With the dragon god’s help, Hoori found the hook, but in the meantime, Hoori had fallen in love with Toyotama hime, the daughter of the dragon god.",,

They live along the riverbanks, where they hunt fish. Their bodies are covered in hair, and the hair on their head resembles the the bobbed okappa hair style once popular among children in Japan. Their most notable features are their webbed hands and toes, and their long teeth which are sharp and jagged like files. They are close relatives of the much more well-known kappa.","Gangi kozō are not encountered outside of the riverbanks, and there may be a good reason for this; according to one theory, they are a transitional form of kappa. According to many legends, kappa transform from river spirits into hairy mountain spirits when the seasons change. The specific details differ quite a bit from place to place. However, in Yamaguchi prefecture, there is a hairy mountain spirit called a takiwaro which transforms into a water spirit called an enko (a variety of kappa). Some folklorists believe that the gangi kozō is a kind of takiwaro, and thus is merely a transitional form of a kappa. This would explain why so little is known of them.","Gangi kozō normally stay away from people, but occasionally encounter fishermen along the rivers they inhabit. When meeting a gangi kozō, fishermen often leave their largest, cheapest fish on the riverside as an offering.","According to Mizuki Shigeru, the name gangi kozō can be written with another set of kanji, 雁木小僧. These characters can mean “stepped pier” or “gear tooth” depending on the context. This writing reflects both the habitat of the gangi kozō as well as its mouth full of sharp teeth, which resembles a toothed gear.","Gangi kozō do not appear in any local legends, though stories of very similar-looking yokai do. The first and only written record of them is in Toriyama Sekien’s yokai encyclopedias. It is therefore possible that gangi kozō was made up by Toriyama Sekien based on the numerous legends of transforming kappa.",,,

They also inhabit large caverns deep underground.","Ōnamazu behave much like their smaller cousins. They dig in the muck, and thrash about when disturbed or excited. Due to their titanic mass, the thrashing of ōnamazu is considerably more violent than ordinary catfish, to the point where they are dangerous to humans. When these monstrous fish get excited, they shake the earth with their violent thrashing, causing devastating earthquakes in the areas near where they live.","Ōnamazu do not normally interact with people, however during the Edo period they were popularly depicted in newspaper illustrations. Usually these pictures showed a huge, grotesque catfish being subdued by a large number of people, gods, or even other yokai, desperately trying to calm its thrashing.","The reason catfish came to represent earthquakes was due to a large number of witnesses observing catfish behaving oddly—thrashing about violently for seemingly no reason—just before the earthquake. Rumor quickly spread that that catfish had some kind of ability to foresee the coming disaster. Since then, the catfish has regularly appeared as a symbol for earthquakes—either as the cause or as a warning sign of the coming disaster. Recent studies have shown that catfish are in fact very electrosensitive and do become significantly more active shortly before an earthquake hits—showing that there is more to this myth than meets the eye!
During the 2011 Tōhoku disaster, the Kashima Shrine was badly damaged by an earthquake. The large stone gate was destroyed, stone lanterns were knocked down, and the water level in the reflecting pond changed. The gate was rebuilt in 2014.","Long ago, common belief was that earthquakes were caused by large dragons which lived deep in the earth. During the Edo period, the idea of catfish causing earthquakes gradually began to displace dragons in popular lore as the origin of seismic activity. By the 1855 Great Ansei Earthquake, the ōnamazu had become the popular culprit to blame for earthquakes. This was due mostly to the hundreds of illustrations of thrashing catfish which accompanied newspapers reporting the news of that disaster. They were so popular they spawned an entire genre of woodblock print: namazu-e (catfish pictures).","The Kashima Shrine in Ibaraki prefecture is the source of a famous story about ōnamazu. The deity of the shrine, a patron deity of martial arts named Takemikazuchi, is said to have subdued an ōnamazu. He pinned it down underneath the shrine, piercing its head and tail with a sacred stone which still remains in the shrine today—the top of the stone protrudes from the ground. Earthquakes that take place during the 10th month of the lunar calendar—”the godless month,” when the gods all travel to Izumo—are said to be due to Takemikazuchi’s absence from the shrine.",,

One of the most common changes is gluttony. Victims become intensely hungry and eat and eat, even going so far as to eat spoiled and ruined food. Although possessed humans grow vast waists from this gluttony, all of the nutrition goes to the tanuki spirits. Victims only grow weaker and weaker until finally they die from malnutrition. Other common symptoms of tanuki possession include unexplained illness, melancholy, becoming overly talkative, sudden outbursts of violence, or abnormally increased libido.","Tanuki possess humans for various reasons, but common ones include revenge for destroying the tanuki’s den, or simply just as a prank. In rare cases, some human families have harnessed the power of animal possession for their own use. Some legends tell of people offering food to old, wild tanuki, taming them, and then using their spirits to possess their enemies.
Because tanuki are powerful yōkai, it is difficult to escape tanuki tsuki. Either the tanuki must leave of its own will, or it must be driven out by a powerful yamabushi, priest, or onmyōji. Another solution is to deify the tanuki. A tanuki elevated to the level of a kami will no longer possess humans. Many villages—particularly in Shikoku—have built shrines to worship particularly troublesome tanuki.",,,,

She takes the appearance of a majestic old woman wearing a 12-layered kimono.,"Osakabe hime is a powerful yōkai, capable of manipulating people like puppets. She is extremely knowledgeable about many things and controls a multitude of kenzokushin—animal-like spirits who act as messengers. She can read a person’s heart and see their true desires. She can then manipulate them any way she pleases. It is rumored that anybody who sees her face will die instantly.","Osakabe hime absolutely hates meeting people. She spends most of her time hidden away in secret areas of Himeji Castle. However, once a year, she comes out of hiding to meet with the castle lord and foretell the castle’s fortune for the next year.","Another common legend is that she was originally the kami of the mountain upon which Himeji Castle was built. When Himeji Castle was expanded by Hideyoshi in the 1580s, the shrine dedicated to the local goddess of Mount Hime, Osakabegami, was removed. The goddess was re-enshrined in Harima Sōja, a shrine dedicated to several gods. In the 1600s, when the lord of the castle, Ikeda Terumasa, fell mysteriously ill, rumors arose that his sickness was due to the goddess’s anger at having been removed. In order to appease her, a small temple was built in the keep and Osakabegami was re-enshrined at the top of her mountain. Osakabegami may be the true identity of Osakabe hime.
Zusho was paralyzed with fear. He heard the sound of a kimono rustling. The door opened up to reveal a beautiful, elegant woman in her thirties wearing a splendid 12-layered kimono. Zusho felt his strength return and politely introduced himself and explained his reason for coming.
Amused, the yōkai replied, “A test of bravery, you say? You will need some proof that you actually saw me.” She gave him a neck guard of a helmet— piece of his master’s own family heirloom armor—to show his master as proof that he met Osakabe hime.
The next day, Zusho told the story of what had happened to his master. Everyone had trouble believing him because they had always heard that the yōkai took the form of an old woman and not a young one. But when Zusho presented the neck guard, his master was shocked and had no choice but to believe the story.","Osakabe hime’s true identity is a mystery. By popular account, she is actually an elderly nine-tailed kitsune who takes the form of this yōkai. According to other accounts, she may be a snake spirit, or the ghost of one of Emperor Fushimi’s favorite courtesans. She may even be the sister of Kame hime, a similar yōkai who lived in Inawashiro Castle in Mutsu Province.","During the Edo period, a young page named Morita Zusho went on a dare to go see if a yōkai really lived in the upper floors of Himeji Castle. He waited until nightfall, and then—paper lantern in hand—he climbed to the top of the keep. As brave as he was, Zusho couldn’t help imagining what would happen to him if there really was such a creature up there. Finally, when he reached the top floor, he saw a faint light coming from a door in the attic. He peeked in, but whoever was inside had heard him. A woman’s voice called out, “Who’s there!?”",,

A nine-tailed magical fox, she is also one of the most powerful yōkai that has ever lived. Her magical abilities were matched only by her trickiness and lust for power. Tamamo no Mae lived during the Heian period, and though she may not have succeeded in her plan to kill the emperor and take his place, her actions destabilized the country and lead it towards one of the most important civil wars in Japanese history. For that reason, Tamamo no Mae is considered one of the Nihon San Dai Aku Yōkai—the Three Terrible Yōkai of Japan.",,,"During the Shang Dynasty Tamamo no Mae was known as Daji. She disguised herself as a beautiful woman and became the favorite concubine of King Zhou of Shang. Daji was a model of human depravity. She held orgies in the palace gardens. Her fondness for watching and inventing new forms of torture are legendary. Daji eventually brought about the fall of the entire Shang Dynasty. She managed to escape execution, and fled to the Magadha kingdom in India in 1046 BCE.
In Magadha, she was known as Lady Kayō, and became a consort of King Kalmashapada, known in Japan as Hanzoku. She used her beauty and charms to dominate the king, causing him to devour children, murder priests, and commit other unspeakable horrors. Eventually—whether because she ran out children to eat or because Kalmashapada began to turn away from her and towards Buddhism—she fled back to China.
During the Zhou Dynasty she called herself Bao Si, and was known as one of the most desirable women in all of China. In 779 BCE she became a concubine of King You. Not satisfied as just a mistress, she manipulated the king into deposing his wife Queen Shen and making Bao Si his new queen. Though she was beautiful, Bao Si rarely ever smiled. In order to please his beautiful new wife, King You committed acts of such evil and atrocity that eventually all of his nobles abandoned and betrayed him. Eventually, King You was killed and Bao Si captured and the Western Zhou Dynasty was brought to an end in 771 BCE. Somehow Bao Si managed to escape again; she went into hiding for many years.
Little is known of her activities until the 700s, when she resurfaced disguised as a 16-year old girl named Wakamo. She tricked the leaders of the 10th Japanese envoy to the Tang Dynasty—Kibi no Makibi, Abe no Nakamaro, and Ganjin—as they were preparing to return home to Japan. Wakamo joined their crew and took the ship to Japan, where she hid herself away for over 300 years.
In the 1090s, she resurfaced once again. This time she transformed herself into a human baby and hid by the side of the road. A married couple found the baby and rescued it, taking her in as their daughter and naming her Mikuzume. She proved to be an exceedingly intelligent and talented young girl, and was so beautiful that she attracted to attention of everyone around her. When she was 7 years old, Mikuzume recited poetry before the emperor. His imperial majesty immediately took a liking to her and employed her as a servant in his court.
Mikuzume excelled at court, absorbing knowledge like a sponge. There was no question she could not answer, whether it was about music, history, astronomy, religion, or Chinese classics. Her clothes were always clean and unwrinkled. She always smelled pleasant. Mikuzume had the most beautiful face in all of Japan, and everyone who saw her loved her.
During the summer of her 18th year, a poetry and instrument recital was held in Mikuzume’s honor. During the recital, an unexpected storm fell upon the palace. All of the candles in the recital room were snuffed, leaving the participants in the dark. Suddenly, a bright light emanated from Mikuzume’s body, illuminating the room. Everybody at court was so impressed by her genius and declared that she must have had an exceedingly good and holy previous life. She was given the name Tamamo no Mae. Emperor Toba, already exceedingly fond of her, made her his consort.
Almost immediately after she became the emperor’s consort, the emperor fell deathly ill. None of the court physicians could determine the cause, and so the onmyōji Abe no Yasunari was called in. Abe no Yasunari read the emperor’s fortune and divined that he was marked by a bad omen. After that, the highest priests and monks were summoned to the palace to pray for the emperor’s health.
The best prayers of the highest priests had no effect, however. The emperor continued to grow worse. Abe no Yasunari was summoned again to read the emperor’s fortune. This time, to his horror the onmyōji discovered that the emperor’s beloved Tamamo no Mae was the cause of his illness. She was a kitsune in disguise, and was shortening the emperor’s life span in order to take over as ruler of Japan. Emperor Toba was reluctant to believe the diviner’s words, but agreed to test Tamamo no Mae just to be sure.
To save the emperor’s life, Abe no Yasunari prepared the Taizan Fukun no Sai, the most secret and most powerful spell known to onmyōdō. Tamamo no Mae was ordered to perform part of the ritual. They reasoned that an evil spirit would not be able to participate in such a holy ritual. Though she was reluctant to participate, the emperor’s ministers persuaded her. They told her that it would increase her standing an admiration among the court. She had little choice but to accept.
When the ritual was performed, Tamamo no Mae dressed even more beautifully than normal. She recited the holy worlds as expected and played her part extremely well. But just as she prepared to wave the ceremonial staff, she vanished. Abe no Yasunari’s divination was confirmed. The court flew into an uproar.
Soon after, word arrived that women and children were disappearing near Nasuno in Shimotsuke Province. The court sorcerers determined that Tamamo no Mae was the cause, and it was decided that she must be destroyed once and for all. The emperor summoned the best warriors in all of the land and then charged the most superb of them, Kazusanosuke and Miuranosuke, to find Tamamo no Mae. The warriors gladly accepted the honor. They purified themselves and set out with an army of 80,000 men to slay the nine-tailed kitsune.
Upon reaching Nasuno the army quickly found the kitsune. The warriors chased her for days and days, but the fox used her magical powers and outsmarted them time and time again, easily escaping. The army grew weary, and frustration set in. It seemed that nothing they did was working. However, Kazusanosuke and Miuranosuke would not accept the shame of defeat and vowed to press on. They practiced harder, honing their tactics, and eventually picked up the kitsune’s trail.
One night, Miuranosuke had a prophetic dream. A beautiful young girl appeared before him, crying. She begged: “Tomorrow I will lose my life to you. Please save me.” Miuranosuke adamantly refused, and upon waking the warriors set out again to find Tamamo no Mae. Sure enough, the next day they caught her. Miuranosuke fired two arrows, one through the fox’s flank and one through its neck. Kazusanosuke swung his blade. It was over, just as the dream had said.
However, Tamamo no Mae’s evil did not end with her death. One year after she died, Emperor Konoe died, heirless. The following year, her lover and former Emperor Toba died as well. A succession crisis ignited between forces loyal to Emperor Go-Shirakawa and forces loyal to former Emperor Sutoku. This crisis started the Fujiwara-Minamoto rivalry that led to the Genpei War, the end of the Heian period, and the rise of the first shoguns. As if that were not enough, Tamamo no Mae’s spirit haunted a massive boulder which killed every living thing that touched it.","Tamamo no Mae appears in numerous texts and has been a popular subject throughout Japanese history. Her story is portrayed in literature, noh, kabuki, bunraku, and other forms of art. There are several variations on her story.","Tamamo no Mae was born some 3,500 years ago in what is now China. Her early life is a mystery, but she eventually became a powerful sorceress. After hundreds of more years she became a white faced, golden furred kyūbi no kitsune—a nine-tailed fox with supreme magical power. In addition, she was an expert at manipulation. She used her charms and wit to advance her standing and influence world affairs.",,

She told him the story of the fox courtesan, and then vanished. Gennō realized that the woman had been the ghost of the infamous kitsune. He performed a Buddhist memorial service over the stone, and suddenly Tamamo no Mae’s spirit reappeared and confessed all of her sins, going back thousands of years all the way to India and China. After hearing Gennō’s pure words and Buddhist teachings, Tamamo no Mae repented all of her evils and swore never again to do wrong, and then disappeared. Her spirit, exorcised from the rock, never harmed anyone again.
Gennō—whose name means hammer—hit the rock and it burst into many pieces. The pieces flew all across Japan, where many of them remain today. The base of the rock still stands in Nasu, Tochigi. Other chunks flew to Okayama, Niigata, Hiroshima, and Ōita where they were enshrined. Smaller fragments landed in present-day Fukui, Gifu, Nagano, Gunma, and parts of Shikoku, where they were picked up and used as magical amulets to perform charms or curses.","Sesshō seki was formed when the evil nine-tailed kitsune Tamamo no Mae was slain. Her hunters returned triumphantly, bearing her body to the capital. Her spirit, however, attached itself to a large boulder near where she fell. It continued to kill long after her death.

Sesshō seki remained a deadly landmark until 1385 CE, when Tamamo no Mae’s spirit was put to rest once and for all.","One day, a high priest named Gennō was traveling through Shimotsuke Province when he noticed a peculiar sight—the birds in the air fell to their deaths whenever they passed over a certain boulder in the plain of Nasuno.

They are sometimes born from pregnant mothers instead of human babies.","When a kekkai emerges, covered in blood and amniotic fluid, it quickly scampers away from its mother and tries to escape. This is most often accomplished through the irori, or earthen hearth, a common feature in old country houses. It either burrows down beneath the floorboards, or climbs up the long pothook which hangs above the irori and flees. If the kekkai is able to escape, it will return later to kill its mother while. It does this by burrowing up through the floorboards and into its sleeping mother, tearing her apart.","A few traditional precautions exist to protect against kekkai. The most important is preparation. A large shamoji—a spatula—is placed by the irori. When the kekkai tries to climb up the pothook, it must be swatted down and caught before it has a chance to escape.","Another common precaution is to surround the floor around the mother with byōbu—folding screens—to prevent a kekkai from escaping. This practice is the source of a play on words surrounding this yōkai’s name: the byōbu creates a spiritual barrier, or kekkai (結界), which prevents the kekkai from escaping.","Kekkai are almost certainly a way to explain the dangers surrounding childbirth and the existence of birth defects. Before modern medicine was invented, death from complications relating to childbirth was not uncommon.

The elderly couple agreed, and Susanoo set in motion his plan to defeat the serpent.
First, Susanoo transformed Kushinada hime into a comb, which he placed in his hair. Then, he had Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi build a large fence with eight gates. On each gate they raised a platform and on each platform they placed a vat. They poured extremely strong sake into each vat. When this was finished, everyone waited for the serpent to arrive.
When Yamata no Orochi appeared, the great serpent slithered into the fence and noticed the powerful sake. It dipped its eight heads into the vats and drank the alcohol. Soon, the monster fell into a deep, drunken sleep. Susanoo used this chance to make his attack. He sliced the enormous beast into tiny pieces with his sword. The carnage was so great that the Hi River flowed with blood. When Susanoo had cut the creature down to its fourth tail, his sword shattered into pieces. Examining the part of Yamata no Orochi’s tail which broke his sword, Susanoo discovered another sword within the creature’s flesh: the legendary katana Murakumo (later known as Kusanagi) no Tsurugi.
Susanoo eventually offered Murakumo as a gift to his sister Amaterasu and was allowed to return to heaven. The sword was passed down through the generations in the imperial line of Japan.

In some villages, it is considered to be a cousin of a certain breed of kappa called gōrai which—every winter—transform from river spirits into mountain spirits called kashambo until they return to the rivers in spring. Ippondatara is said to be a kind of kashambo.
Other explanations describe the ippondatara as the ghost of a woodcutter who cut off one of his legs in penance for some crime. Or it may be the ghost of a famous one-legged, one-eyed robber named Hitotsudatara who lived in the mountains of Wakayama and had supernatural strength. It may even be the ghost of a giant boar who used to roam the mountains killing hunters. A high priest was able to bind the boar’s spirit and keep it from harming people, but the conditions of the magic that binds this ghost allow it to roam free one day per year—on December 20th.
It has also been suggested that it is a kind of mountain kami which was corrupted over the ages and became a yōkai. A single eye is a common feature among mountain spirits, and other one-eyed yōkai (such as hitotsume kozō) originated as mountain kami as well.","The name ippondatara comes from tatara, the bellows that a blacksmith would use in the old days. This yōkai is said to resemble a master blacksmith who lost the use of one eye from years of starting at the intense flames, and lost the use of one leg from years of heavy work pumping the bellows.",,,

In addition, this mischievous yokai chews the scalp of a person good enough to carry it, further adding to his misery. In order to protect against the head-chewing that obariyon inflict, some villages developed a custom of wearing metal bowls on their heads for protection.","According to some tales, as the obariyon becomes heavier and heavier, it eventually crushes its victim under its weight. However, more commonly, when a person has dutifully carried the obariyon the whole way home, he or she finds that the strange burden was a sack of money all along, and becomes incredibly rich.","Although the exact origins of this particular creature are unclear, folk tales about yokai which demand to be carried or cared for are quite common across Japan. There is a recurring theme among folk tales that those who persevere when dealing with children will prosper. Just as those who put up with the strange demands of the obariyon may find themselves blessed with a bag of gold, those who manage to deal with the demands of raising young children will eventually reap treasures beyond belief. Obariyon is probably a direct metaphor about child-rearing. While the demands of the obariyon may be selfish and extremely burdensome, those who are willing to put up with it for the entire journey find the payoff was well worth the investment.","The name obariyon comes from a phrase in local Niigata dialect meaning “give me a piggyback ride!” Differences in local dialects are reflected in the many different local names for this spirit. Though its name varies from place to place, it is always a local variant for a childish request to be carried piggyback style.",,,

However, because ashura are so controlled by their emotions, it is almost impossible for them to achieve enlightenment, become buddhas, and escape the cycle of endless reincarnation.

What is certain is that it lurks outside of bathrooms on New Year’s Eve, and peeks into the window at people using the toilet. What happens next varies from place to place. In general, this yōkai brings bad luck in the coming year. In more recent stories, kanbari nyūdō tries to stroke or lick the person using the toilet. Sometimes, it inflicts constipation upon those who see it.","The cuckoo connection does actually trace back to China. It was considered bad luck to hear a cuckoo’s call in the toilet—if you hear a cuckoo while using the toilet, you have to bark like a dog to counter the curse.
This yōkai’s name is also a mystery. It can be written in many different ways using many different kanji, although none of them have a particular meaning. They appear to be ateji—kanji chosen solely for their phonetic readings. Jippensha Ikku, an Edo period author, wrote about ganbari nyūdō using kanji meaning “stretched eyes”—very appropriate considering this yōkai’s propensity for peeping. However, as no earlier stories use those kanji for the name, it is certainly his own (very clever) fabrication. Ganbari may also be connected to the word ganbaru, which means to try hard and persevere—which may or may not be related to certain bathroom activities. But this is almost certainly a connection made after the fact, rather than being the origin of this yōkai’s name.
In most areas, kanbari nyūdō are thought to be bringers of bad luck. If one enters the toilet on New Year’s Eve and chants the spell, “ganbari nyūdō, hototogisu!” (“ganbari priest, cuckoo!”) this yōkai will not appear, and thus the following year will not be unlucky. On the other hand, in other areas, chanting the same phrase or even remembering those magic words is unlucky enough to guarantee an entire year of bad luck.","Kanbari nyūdō’s history and origins are confused and convoluted. According to Toriyama Sekien, this yōkai originally comes from the Chinese god of the toilet, Kakutō. Because the characters used to write Kakutō are similar to the characters used to write the Japanese word for cuckoo, this may have been intended as a pun on Sekien’s part. However, Kakutō was not, in fact, a Chinese toilet god. He was actually a 15th century Ming general.","Stories about kanbari nyūdō differ wildly from region to region. According to some local legends, if you enter an outhouse on New Year’s Eve at the hour of the ox, between 1 and 3 am, and peer down into the hole and chant “ganbari nyūdō” three times, a human head will appear in the hole. If you then take that head and insert it into your left kimono sleeve and then take it back out, it will turn into a koban—an oval-shaped gold coin. In other regions, the human head must instead be wrapped up inside of a silk cloth and taken back to one’s room. When the cloth is unwrapped, it will be filled with gold.",,

Looking out, he saw a woman standing pathetically in the rain, cold and drenched. He asked her if she needed help, but all she said was, “One candy please.” Even though the shop was closed, the shopkeeper felt sorry for the poor woman, so he sold her the candy. She paid him one mon—a very low denomination coin—and vanished into the night.
The next night, she came at the very same time, looking forlorn and disheveled. Again, she asked the shopkeeper, in a voice almost too faint to hear, “One candy please.” The shopkeeper gave her a candy, and again she paid with one mon, and left just as quietly as she had come.
Every night for six nights, this exact scenario played out. On the seventh night, she returned, but this time had no money. When she asked “One candy please,” she presented a handful of leaves. The shopkeeper told her that he could not accept leaves as payment. “Then take this instead,” she said, handing him her coat. The shopkeeper protested, but she insisted. Finally he gave in and accepted the trade.
The next day, a merchant from a neighboring village passed through the town. He stopped in his friend’s shop, and the shopkeeper told him of the strange woman who came visiting every night, and of the coat that she gave him as payment.

“Really? Perhaps it was she who came to the store?”
“That is impossible! She died one week ago. She was buried in this coat!”
The merchant and the shopkeeper looked at each other in disbelief. They went to the temple where she was buried to tell the head priest what the shopkeeper had seen. The priest scolded them for believing in such superstitions. Afterwards he took them to the woman’s grave to show them that all was okay. When they reached the grave, however, they heard the unmistakable screaming of a newborn baby coming from under the earth!
They dug up the grave and discovered that it was indeed the corpse woman who had been visiting the shop! What’s more, entwined in her arms, a living baby wrapped up in cloth. The woman had given birth posthumously in her coffin. Wrapped up with the baby were the six mostly-eaten pieces of candy, which had kept the baby from starving during the week. Its mother had bought the candy with the six mon traditionally placed with a corpse to pay the guardians of the underworld.
They took the baby from the corpse and returned it to its family. When they reburied the woman’s body, the corpse had a serene expression on its face.

When it got crowded—particularly during festival seasons—the taxi drivers got into carriage fights. They slammed their carriages against each other to grab the best spots for sightseeing. Just like parking can be a problem in cities today, parking in ancient Kyōto was a huge source of frustration.
The resentment of nobles who didn’t get the prime sightseeing spot they wanted was something to be feared. The negative feelings could build up and become a powerful force of their own, which is where these yōkai come from. Oboroguruma materialized out of the wrath of nobles who lost these carriage fights and were not able to reserve the sightseeing spots that they wanted.","Carriage yōkai have existed in picture scrolls for hundreds of years. They may originally have been a kind of tsukumogami, or object-turned-yōkai. Most of these scrolls were created for their vivid imagery rather than for any particular story. Oboroguruma may have initially been created without any backstory. When Toriyama Sekien published his yōkai bestiaries, he included the oboroguruma and gave a description.

It was a common practice during large construction projects from ancient times through the 16th century. However there is evidence that hitobashira were still being used in some construction projects during the 20th century.","This form of sacrifice was used as a magical ward for the building being constructed. It was believed that the sacrifice of a human soul would appease the nature spirits in an area—particularly the river spirits in areas where flooding was common. They were also used to ward castles against assault, fire, and other disasters both man-made and natural.",,"While Maruoka Castle was being constructed, its walls kept collapsing no matter how many times they were repaired. It was decided that a person should be sacrificed and made into a hitobashira in order to improve the stability of the castle. A poor, one-eyed woman named Oshizu was selected for the honor of becoming a hitobashira. As a reward for her sacrifice, she was promised that her son would be made a samurai. After she was sacrificed the castle was completed. However, before her son could be made a samurai, the castle’s lord was transferred to another province, and the promise was left unkept.
Every year thereafter, the castle’s moat overflowed when the heavy spring rains came. The people of Maruoka blamed this on Oshizu’s vengeance, and called this rain “tears of Oshizu’s sorrow.” Afterwards, a cenotaph was erected for Oshizu inside the castle grounds to calm her spirit.","Although hitobashira literally means human pillar, the actual meaning is more complicated. Pillars and Shinto have a long relationship—kami can be enshrined in pillar-like sacred trees, the oldest shrines were built upon pillars, and hashira, in addition to meaning pillar, is also used as the josūshi—Japanese counter word—for kami. The bashira in hitobashira refers not to a literal pillar, but actually to this counter word. The human was enshrined in a manner similar to a kami of the building to which he or she was sacrificed, becoming both a literal pillar and a connection to the gods. Very often, small stone memorials were erected in honor of the hitobashira who were sacrificed to a building. Some still stand today.","A few famous castles in Japan are connected to legends of hitobashira.

This is the period of darkest night, when the border between the world of the living and the world of the dead is weakest. During this hour, evil spirits are at their greatest power.",,"There are a number of complicated steps required to perform this curse ritual, and they vary from account to account. In general, you must first construct a wara ningyō containing a small piece of the intended target’s body—a piece of hair, blood, fingernails, or skin, for example. Alternatively, you may use an image of their target, or a piece of paper with the target’s name written on it. Then, you put on the ceremonial dress—a white kimono and obi, with thick white face powder. An upturned trivet is placed on your head, and you attach tapers to its legs and light them. Tall, single-toothed geta are worn on your feet. A mirror is carried over your breast, a dagger is tucked behind the obi, and a comb is held between your teeth.","Thus prepared, you must sneak into a shrine during the hour of the ox and approach the shrine’s sacred tree. Then, you hammer a long iron nail through the wara ningyō into the tree—symbolically breaking the barrier between the world of the living and the spirit world. You call out to evil spirits, demons, and yōkai to come into the world. This ritual must be repeated every night for many nights, and it is very important that the person performing the curse not be seen. If there are any witnesses, they must be killed immediately. Otherwise the evil of this curse will rebound onto the caster.
Once the ritual is completed, something—it is not clear what—terrible happens. According to some accounts, the curse victim dies an agonizing death upon completion of the ritual. In other accounts, the entire process is torture for the victim, causing days of suffering while the curse is being performed. In some stories, the curse summons yōkai which haunt the victim, and in other stories, the person performing the ritual transforms into a powerful oni or kijo.",,"A few shrines are well-known for this sort of black magic.

Famous tatarigami include gods such as Emperor Gozu, the bull-headed demon god, and Yamata no Orochi, the eight-headed eight-tailed dragon. Also included are the onryō of important historical figures such as Mononobe no Moriya, Emperor Sutoku, Sugawara no Michizane, and Taira no Masakado.

During the Heian period, Kyōto suffered a number of outbreaks which were thought to be caused by Susanoo and Gozu tennō—two powerful gods of disease and destruction. In order to appease their wrath, a festival was held in their honor at the Yasaka Shrine in Gion. To keep the city free from disease, the festival was repeated every year. Eventually the connection to Susanoo and Emperor Gozu was lost, but the festival traditions remain to this day.

He lived from 845 to 903 CE, and is considered one of the greatest scholars and poets in all of Japanese history. After his death, he returned from the grave as a wrathful onryō to wreak his vengeance upon those who had wronged him in life. This earned him a position among the Nihon San Dai Onryō—the Three Great Onryō of Japan.",,,"Sugawara no Michizane was an excellent student and scholar. Passing the highest level of government exams at age 26, he received the equivalent of a PhD at age 33. Michizane was selected to be governor of Sanuki Province in 886. During his time as governor he composed a great deal of poetry. In 888, during the Akō Incident, he supported Emperor Uda in his rivalry with Fujiwara no Mototsune. This action earned him a great deal of political clout. When the Emperor consolidated his power, he demoted officials from the Fujiwara clan and promoted officials from the Minamoto clan. Michizane was not a noble, but he too was rewarded. Hs rank rose even further, and he picked up many important court titles, including Ambassador to the Tang Dynasty. This caused unrest among the nobles—particularly the Fujiwaras. They felt indignant that a non-noble scholar should be elevated to such elite ranks.
When Emperor Uda abdicated to Emperor Daigo, Sugawara no Michizane’s fortunes declined rapidly. Both Michizane and Fujiwara no Tokihira—the son of Fujiwara no Mototsune, whom Michizane had censured years ago—were the emperor’s primary advisors. Tokihira advised the emperor that he should pacify the indignant Fujiwara nobility by sending Michizane away. The emperor listened. Michizane lost his rank and titles, and was demoted from his high position to very minor regional government post at Dazaifu, Chikuzen Province. There, he experienced a thankless life of hard work under much stricter and more severe conditions than in Kyōto.
Despite his humiliation and exile to Kyūshū, Sugawara no Michizane continued to work hard and earnestly for the sake of the country. All the while he prayed for the well-being of the imperial family and the safety of Japan. His hard work was never acknowledged, and he never regained his prestige. He regretted his demotion, and longed for his beloved Kyōto for the rest of his life. Late in the second month of 903, as the plums were blossoming, Michizane died. His heart was filled with loneliness and resentment.
Sugawara no Michizane’s onryō continued to curse the capital with disaster upon disaster. Eventually, the emperor built a shrine to his spirit and posthumously restored his rank and office. He removed any mention of Michizane’s exile from the official records. However, it did not appease his spirit, and the disasters kept coming. Finally, in 987, during the reign of Emperor Ichijō, Sugawara no Michizane was promoted and deified as the highest rank of state kami. A special shrine was built for him in northern Kyōto, and a festival was established in his honor. Michizane became known as Tenman Tenjin, the god of scholarship. The curse was finally appeased.
Tenjin remains a popular god to this day. Paintings of him are hung in homes across the country, and students from all over Japan visit his shrines to pray for luck on their school examinations. Tenjin shrines commonly hold festivals in late February, when plum trees start to bloom, and when school examination results are posted. The plum tree is commonly associated with Tenjin, as it was his favorite tree. Shrines dedicated to him commonly have plum trees on their grounds. Legend has it that while in exile in Dazaifu, he longed so deeply for his favorite plum tree that one night it flew from Kyōto to Kyūshū to be with him. That tree still stands today at the Dazaifu Tenman-gu in Fukuoka.","Sugawara no Michizane was born the eldest son of a high-ranking family of scholars. From a very early age, he showed his brilliance, composing elegant poems by the age of five. He was well-educated and lived a privileged life, gradually climbing the ranks of the bureaucracy and increasing his public standing.","After Sugawara no Michizane’s death, a series of disasters struck Kyōto. Plague and drought spread over the city. His rival Fujiwara no Tokihira died at the age of 39. The sons of Emperor Daigo became sick and died one after another. A lightning bolt struck the Seiryōden palace, causing a fire which killed a number of the officials who had participated in Michizane’s demotion and exile. A few months later, Emperor Daigo himself became sick and died.

After he died, he transformed—some say into a terrible onryō, some say into a great tengu—and inflicted his wrath upon the imperial court at Kyōto. Along with Sugawara no Michizane and Taira no Masakado, he is one of the legendary Nihon San Dai Onryō—the Three Great Onryō of Japan.",,,"After Shirakawa died in 1129, retired Emperor Toba began orchestrating his trap against Emperor Sutoku. He convinced him that the cloistered life of retired emperor was much better than being the actual emperor. He suggested that Sutoku adopt Toba’s son Prince Narihito, and retire. In 1142, Sutoku finally did so. Toba oversaw the process, and made sure to record that the emperor was retiring and passing the throne on to Narihito instead of his own progeny. This ensured that Sutoku would wield no power over the young emperor, nor would any future son ever become emperor. The 3-year old Narihito became Emperor Konoe, and the retired Emperor Toba wielded all of the power behind the throne. Toba sent Sutoku’s allies to distant provinces, and filled the capital with his own allies. There was nothing Sutoku could do.
Emperor Konoe remained sickly and childless his whole life. He passed away without an heir in 1155 at the age of 17. By this time, Sutoku had his own son. He saw an opportunity to recover his standing. Sutoku and his allies claimed that the throne should pass on to Sutoku’s son. Instead the imperial court declared that Toba’s fourth son would become Emperor Go-Shirakawa. When Toba died the following year, this dispute escalated into a miniature civil war known as the Hōgen Rebellion. The war was decided in a single battle. The forces of Go-Shirakawa were victorious.
After the Hōgen Rebellion, Go-Shirakawa’s forces were merciless. Those who fought against the emperor were executed, along with their entire families. Former Emperor Sutoku was banished from Kyōto and forced to spend the rest of his days exiled to Sanuki Province. He shaved his head and became a monk, devoting himself copying holy manuscripts to send back to Kyōto. The court feared that the deposed Sutoku would attempt to curse them. It was rumored that he had bitten off his own tongue and wrote the manuscripts in his own blood, imbuing them with his hatred for the merciless imperial court. The court added insult to injury by refusing to accept any of his manuscripts.
In 1164, Sutoku passed away, defeated, deposed, and humiliated—and most importantly full of rage for the imperial court. When news of his death reached Emperor Go-Shirakawa, the emperor ignored it. He ordered that nobody should go into mourning, and that no state funeral would be held for such a criminal.
Afterwards, for many years, disaster upon disaster struck the capital. Go-Shirakawa’s successor, Emperor Nijo, died suddenly at age 23. Storms, plagues, fires, droughts, and earthquakes all pounded the capital. Imperial power weakened. Clan rivalries set into motion by the Hōgen Rebellion escalated. Many of Go-Shirakawa’s allies were killed in battles, and the country stepped closer and closer to all-out civil war. In 1180, the Genpei War broke out. In 5 bloody years, the power of the imperial court had vanished, and the Kamakura shogunate took over Japan. All of this was attributed to Emperor Sutoku’s vengeance.
Sutoku finally returned to the capital during the Meiji era. In 1868, he was enshrined as a kami in the Shiramine Shrine in Kyōto. The Takaya Shrine in Kagawa also enshrines one of the stones onto which Sutoku’s blood flowed during the rainstorm before his cremation. Despite this, there are still rumors that his curse might still linger. In 2012, when NHK broadcast the drama Taira no Kiyomori, an earthquake struck the Kanto region right at the moment when Emperor Sutoku transformed into an onryō.","Prince Akihito was born in 1119 CE, the first son of Emperor Toba. At least that was on the official registry. It was an open secret, known by everyone in the court, that Akihito was actually sired by the retired former Emperor Shirakawa. Akihito was not well liked by his “father,” who constantly referred to him as a bastard. His true father Shirakawa may have been the former emperor, but he still wielded considerable power in his retirement. When Prince Akihito was 5 and Emperor Toba was 21, Shirakawa forced Toba into retirement. Akihito became Emperor Sutoku.","After his death, strange things began to happen. Sutoku’s body was set aside while its caretakers awaited funeral instructions from the emperor. After 20 days, his body was still as fresh as it had been on the day he died. While his coffin was taken to be cremated, a terrible storm rolled in. The caretakers placed the casket on the ground to take shelter. After the storm passed, the stones around the casket were soaked with fresh blood. When his body was finally cremated, the ashes descended upon Kyōto in a dark cloud.",,

Others say that she is angry at humanity for not helping her when she was dying, and that she is simply out to slaughter as many people as she can. When she catches you, she will tear you in half and steal the lower half of your body.
Shortly after hearing the legend, she will ask you a riddle, either in a dream, or in a mysterious phone call. The only way to escape death is to answer her questions exactly the right way. She will ask you: “Do you need your legs?” You must reply: “I need them right now.” Then, she will ask you: “Who told you my story?” You must reply: “Kashima Reiko.

If you love me, come and visit, in the forest of Shinoda in Izumi, the resentful kudzu leaf
When Yasuna read her poem, he realized that his beloved wife was the fox whom he had saved years earlier. He and their son traveled to the forests of Shinoda, where Kuzunoha had first entered the world of humankind. There, Kuzunoha appeared before them one last time. She presented them a crystal ball and a golden box as parting gifts, and then she left her human family forever.
Kuzunoha and Yasuna’s son grew up to become a powerful sorcerer, thanks to the magical gifts his mother had given him, her yōkai lineage, and his father’s onmyōji training. He took the name Abe no Seimei, and became the most powerful onmyōji in all of Japanese history.","Kuzunoha is a byakko, or white kitsune. She is most famous for being the wife of Abe no Yasuna and the mother of Abe no Seimei. Her story is preserved in a number of kabuki and bunraku plays. The Inari shrine near where Abe no Yasuna first met Kuzunoha still stands today, and is popularly known as the Kuzunoha Shrine.","During the reign of Emperor Murakami (946—967 CE), the onmyōji Abe no Yasuna sought to rebuild his family house. The Abe family had once been a rich and powerful one, but their land and status were lost years before by Yasuna’s father, who had been tricked by con men. While rebuilding his house, Yasuna regularly traveled to the Inari shrine in Shinoda, Izumi Province, to pray for the god’s blessings.",,
https://yokai.com/kitsunetsuki/,Kitsune tsuki,狐憑き,きつねつき,fox possession,,,,"Some kitsune are able to possess human beings and cause them to behave in strange ways. Compared with other types of animal spirit possessions, kitsune tsuki is a relatively common form of possession in humans. A person possessed by a fox spirit often develops physical features that appear fox-like, such as sharper teeth or a streamlined, pointy face. For much of Japanese history—until modern medicine was introduced—mental illness and insanity were usually blamed on kitsune tsuki.",,"There are three main types of kitsune possession: possession of an individual, possession of a family, and possession for use as a medium.","When a kitsune possesses an individual, it is often in retaliation for something done to the kitsune—killing one of its family members, for example. The possessing spirit causes its host to behave erratically and emotionally, making them prone to violent outbreaks and hysteria. People possessed by kitsune sometimes run naked through the streets, foam at the mouth, and yelp like a fox. Kitsune can speak through their hosts mouths. Victims are often able to speak and read languages that they previously had no knowledge of. Kitsune can even control their hosts like a puppet, causing them to do all sorts of evil things. According to folklore, women are more susceptible to fox possession than men. Kitsune are also said to possess people who are weak-minded.
When a kitsune possesses a family, that family becomes rich and fertile. These families were called kitsune mochi, and were able to manipulate the possessing kitsune spirits. In addition to bringing prosperity to their owners, kitsune could be used to bring ruin upon a family’s enemies. Kitsune mochi people used these spirits to place curses, possess, or bring sickness to others. Kitsune mochi families kept their fox spirits for generations, handing down their secrets from parent to child. A kitsune mochi family would honor and care for its possessing spirit, for it could just as easily bring the same ruin upon their entire family line. People suspected of belonging to kitsune mochi families were mistrusted for their unnatural abilities and feared by their neighbors. Even today, in some parts of Japan, people belonging to these lineages occasionally have trouble finding marriage partners, as few parents would allow their son or daughter to join such a family.
Kitsune tsuki for use as a medium involves inviting a kitsune to possess a willing person in order to perform divinations. A kitsune would enter the medium’s body and speak through her mouth, predicting the future or giving secret knowledge. This was a very dangerous practice, as it relies on the willingness of the kitsune to leave the body after the possession—and kitsune are very powerful creatures.
Recognizing possession in a person can be difficult if the victim does not display any obvious physical signs. However, there are a few ways to diagnose kitsune possession. Despite living in a human’s body, kitsune retain certain traits which can betray their presence. All kitsune love fried tofu and azuki beans. A possessed person will strongly crave these foods, often eating them large amounts and not filling up. A possessed person also develops a strong fear of dogs. In addition, a small lump can often be found hidden on the victim’s body. This is the place where the fox spirit resides. If pushed or pricked, this lump slips away and hides in another part of the body. It cannot be caught or removed by any physical means.
Because of widespread belief in fox possession, a number of folk cures have been invented over the centuries to deal with it. Exorcism was usually performed at Inari shrines, as foxes are sacred to Inari. One fairly benign treatment included having the victim licked from head to toe by dogs, which foxes fear intensely. Other less fortunate victims were beaten or burned in attempts to drive out the fox spirit. In some cases, priests would burn fresh pine leaves, suffocating the patient in thick, toxic smoke in an attempt to drive out the possessing spirit. Unfortunately this sometimes killed the patient before driving out the kitsune. In the end, even if the victim was cured of the possession, the families of people accused of kitsune tsuki often suffered ostracism and social isolation for the rest of their lives.",,,,

She is practically indistinguishable from an ordinary old woman, which makes her difficult to recognize as a yōkai until it is too late.",,"Amazake babā appears on winter nights and travels from house to house. She knocks on doors and calls out, “Might you have any amazake?” Those who answer her, whether the answer is yes or no, fall terribly ill.

She travels from house to house trying to sell sake and amazake. The consequences of replying to her are the same as with amazake babā, but the way to keep her at bay is slightly different. If you hang a sign at the front door that says “we do not like sake or amazake,” she will leave you alone and go on to the next house.
Since the eradication of smallpox, the sickness spread by amazake babā’s has changed from smallpox to the common cold. Even today, statues of her can be found in cities. Mothers visit these statues to leave offerings of sake and amazake so that that their children will not become sick.","Originally amazake babā was considered to be a god of disease—specifically smallpox. During smallpox outbreaks, there was a large increase in amazake babā sightings in major urban centers across Japan, not just in the northeast. Rumors of old women roaming the streets at night selling sake and bringing sickness were rampant in large cities such as Edo, Kyōto, Osaka, and Nagoya.

They are very similar in appearance and behavior to yuki onna, which inhabit the same areas during wintertime. When the winter snows melt and icicles can no longer be seen hanging from roofs, tsurara onna disappear along with the cold weather.",,"Despite their icy origins, tsurara onna can be quite warm and loving spirits. In fact, many stories of tsurara onna involve one which has fallen in love with and married a human. These marriages invariably end in tragedy. The beautiful bride inevitably leaves when the spring comes, leaving her mate confused and heartbroken. And any future encounters the following winter usually do not end well for either party, if the legends are to be believed.","Because they look and behave like ordinary human women, it is often very difficult to identify a tsurara onna. One recognizable warning sign is an unwillingness to enter a bath. Occasionally, stories tell of a woman who refuses to take a bath no matter how much her husband pressures her. Eventually, tired of fighting, she relents and enters the bath. When the husband checks on her later, all he sees are a few tiny shards of ice floating in the tub, and his wife is nowhere to be found.
One iconic example from Echigo Province—modern day Niigata Prefecture—goes like this: a young, single man gazed out his window on a cold, snowy night. He sat there, wistfully admiring the lovely winter scene. He wished in his heart that he could find a wife as beautiful as the icicles hanging from his roof. Suddenly, he heard a knock at his door. A woman’s voice called out, and it was as beautiful and clear as ice.
“Excuse me! I was traveling along this road, but the snowstorm became too fierce and I cannot journey any further. Might I lodge at your house for the night?”
The young man of course accepted (what young man would refuse such a request?), and he was delighted to see the woman’s face was as beautiful as her voice. He worked hard to make sure her stay was as enjoyable as possible.
Several months later, the woman was still staying at the house… In fact, she and the young man had fallen deep in love and she forgot about her journey entirely. They had gotten married and were very happy together.
One spring morning, the beautiful young bride went out shopping. That night she did not return. The young man waited her return night after night. The snows melted, the plum blossoms bloomed, and soon it was spring. The young man asked everyone he met if they had seen his wife. He searched all around, but there was no sign of her at all. Nobody he met could tell him anything either. He slowly forced himself to accept that she had left him. Over time, the young man’s broken heart healed, and he was remarried to young woman from his village.
The following winter, during a snowstorm, the young man found himself looking out the window at the long icicles hanging from his roof. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The beautiful woman from the previous winter was standing outside of his house. The young man was shocked.
“I searched for you every day! What is the meaning of this? How could you just vanish like that without a word?” he cried.
The woman replied, “People have different circumstances you know… But we promised to love each other forever. You said that our bond was as long and as solid as the beautiful icicles hanging from your roof. And yet… you have remarried.”
The beautiful woman left the house with a sad look on her face. The young man started after her, when suddenly there was a voice from inside the house. It was his new wife, asking what was going on.
“It’s nothing. Stay inside.”
Suddenly there was loud crash followed by a shriek near the front of the house. The new wife ran to the front door to see what had happened. There, lying in the front yard, was her husband. He was dead, pierced through the brain by an enormous icicle which had fallen from the roof.",,"There are countless tales of tsurara onna. They are found in every prefecture where snow falls, and each one has its own unique twist. However, there are a few common motifs found in most versions of the story.

He is ugly, with a large, hulking body, a long, flowing beard, and fearsome, piercing eyes. He is usually shown carrying a sword and wearing a court official’s cap. Shōki is known as “the demon queller” for his ability to vanquish, exorcise, and even control oni and other demons. He is so feared by oni that even his image is said to scare them away. The demons he defeats sometimes become his servants. It is said that he commands 80,000 demons.",,,"Shōki was devastated. His dreams shattered, he committed suicide on the steps of the imperial palace. The emperor was moved by Shōki’s dedication. He felt great regret for denying the application of such a talented and brilliant man on account of his looks. The emperor ordered that Shōki should receive a state burial of the highest rank—usually only reserved for royalty—and posthumously awarded him the title “Doctor of Zhongnanshan.”
Years later, the emperor became gravely ill. Delirious with fever, he dreamed that he saw two oni. The larger one was wearing the clothing of a court official. It grabbed the smaller oni, killed it, and ate it. Then, it turned to the emperor and introduced itself as Shōki. He vowed to protect the emperor from evil. When the emperor woke up, his fever was gone.
Xuanzong commissioned the court painter to make an painting of Shōki based on his dream. Shōki became a popular deity across China (and later, Japan). He was revered as a god of scholarship for his great devotion to his studies, and as a protector against disease and evil spirits.","Shōki originated in ancient China during the 700’s. His story reached Japan by the late Heian period, and his popularity reached its height during the Edo period. Paintings and statues of him are still used as a good luck charms. His image appears on flags, folding screens, and hanging scrolls. Small statues of him can sometimes be seen on the roofs of older houses in Kyoto as well. Shōki is strongly associated with Boys’ Day, a holiday in May. He is revered as a god of protection from demons and sickness (particularly smallpox, which was believed to be spread by evil spirits), and also as a god of scholarship.","Shōki lived in Shanxi Province in China during the Tang dynasty. His life’s goal was to become a physician in the court of Emperor Xuanzong. Shōki was a smart and diligent student. He trained hard and passed all of the exams to become a physician.

It is white, with large eyes that stare off into the distance as if lost in thought. It floats about in the air, aimlessly wandering about.",,,"While it shiro ukari literally means “white floater,” both of these words carry a number of nuances which could refer to this spirit’s true nature. Shiro not only refers to the color white, but to a state of total innocence or naivety. Whereas ao (blue) is used in many yokai to refer to a novice or an apprentice, shiro can refer to a state of total, absolute naivete. It has a negative connotation, akin to a “fool” or a “country bumpkin” in English. The urban socialites of Edo looked down on the “shiro” people who lived in the rural areas outside of the capital. While not specifically stated, the vacant expression on this yōkai’s face could be an allusion to this alternate meaning of shiro.
Ukari comes from the word for floating, which has a number of different implications. The most literal meaning is to float about from place to place. There is also a nuance of absentmindedness or disconnect from others. Tourists who feel out of place in a strange city might be described as floating about in this way. It can also refer to merrymaking, particularly in a way that is disconnected with the real world. This is the same origin as the word ukiyo, which refers to the “floating world”—the urban, pleasure-seeking lifestyle of old Edo. In a spiritual sense, this word can also refer to spirits which have not been able to pass on to the next world due to the weight of their sins. They float about, but never ascend, and are doomed to haunt this world.
Perhaps shiro ukari is a pun describing the uncouth, naive rural bumpkins who Edo urbanites thought had no business being in their city. Their experience in the capital might be something like a wide-eyed ghost floating from place to place. Perhaps it is a yōkai which seeks out the impermanent pleasures of life just as the humans of old Edo did. Or perhaps it is the spirit of someone who is unable to ascend into the next world, and they are forced by the weight of their sins to float about and wander aimlessly for the rest of their existence.","Shiro ukari appears on a few Edo period scroll paintings, and nowhere else. It was invented by an artist rather than recorded from folklore. Aside from its name, nothing is written about it.

They beckon the divers closer to them, offering shellfish and sea urchins as a way to lure them deeper. They continue to lure the divers deeper and farther away from safety. Eventually the divers are either lured too deep or too far from the shore, and they drown.","In order to protect themselves from tomokazuki, superstitious ama will carry magic charms with them while diving; usually in the form of the seiman and dōman symbols on their headbands.
In one story from Shizuoka, an ama and her husband took a boat out to sea to dive for shellfish. While deep underweater, the ama saw a tomokazuki and quickly surfaced to tell her husband. He mocked her for believing such stupid things, and ordered her to keep working. The ama dove back down as her husband commanded. She was never seen again.
In Fukui Prefecture there is yōkai called an umiama, which is very similar to a tomokazuki. When an ama dives down to the sea floor, the umiama surfaces. Then, when the ama surfaces, the umiama dives down to the sea floor. Because of this, it is very difficult to spot this yōkai. However, those unlucky few who do manage to see it become gravely ill shortly afterwards.","One popular explanation among believers is that tomokazuki are the ghosts of drowned ama. Since they are only ever seen by ama deep under the water, belief in tomokazuki is not common.

They are capable of eating things that are much larger than their bodies, and in quantities that seem like more than they should be able to eat. They are also extremely fond of drinking, and can consume huge quantities of sake. Like many animals, snakes are believed to have a variety of magical powers. They can shape-shift into various objects and creatures, including humans. They can even control the elements to some extent. Natural disasters such as floods and rock slides are often attributed to uwabami.","In addition to eating large volumes of food and alcohol, uwabami also like to feed on people. They set up ambushes and assault travelers in mountain passes. Because of their size, they can easily swallow a full grown human whole—and they often do. However, they are sometimes outsmarted by clever people, who live to tell others of what they saw.","The name uwabami has roots going back to archaic Japanese. The first part of the name, uwa, meant skillful or superior. Gradually this shifted to a similar sounding word, uha, which meant great or large. The second part of the name is from an archaic word for snake, hami. This word derives from the word for eating, hamu, which refers both to the snake’s fondness for biting and its ability to eat things that appear much larger than it. So uwabami were “skillful eaters” which over time became “giant snakes.”
Another linguistic point of interest is that the word “uwabami” also has the colloquial meaning of “heavy drinker.” The reason for this is the uwabami’s great love for sake and its ability to drink in far alcohol more than even a creature as large as it should be able to.
Long ago, there was an daija who lived in Ōnuma Lake. Every year he would transform into an extremely handsome young man and travel to the eastern mountains to view the cherry blossoms. One spring, he spied a beautiful young woman all by herself under the blossoms. The woman was Kuro hime, the daughter of Takanashi Masamori, a powerful lord of Shinano Province. Kuro hime also spied the handsome man who was watching her and found him irresistable. The two became acquainted and soon fell in love.
Some time later, the handsome young man paid a visit to the castle of Takanashi Masamori. He introduced himself as the great snake who lives in Ōnuma Lake, guardian deity of the Shiga Highlands. He explained that he and Kuro hime were in love, and asked the lord for her hand in marriage. Masamori immediately snapped that he would never give his daughter to someone that was not human.
The young man did not give up, and returned day after day to ask for Kuro hime’s hand in marriage. Finally, the lord relented and gave his conditions: “If you can keep up with me on horseback and complete seven laps around my castle, I will give you my daughter.” The young man eagerly accepted and agreed to return to the castle in a few days for the race.
Masamori was not about to let his daughter marry a snake. He devised a plan to kill the creature so it would leave him and his daughter alone forever. He had his servants plant swords in the grass all around the castle. Masamori was an expert rider and knew where the swords were hidden, so he would easily be able to avoid the traps.
When the day of the race came, the young man showed up at the castle as promised. The race began, and Takanashi Masamori spurred his horse into action. He was indeed an expert rider, and the young man could not keep up with the lord. He had to transform back into a snake in order to keep pace with the horse. The swords planted around the castle perimeter pierced and tore the snakes body, but he did not give up. Finally, the lord and the snake completed their seven laps. The snake’s body was ragged, and rivers of blood flowed from his body. Immediately upon finishing his final lap, the daija collapsed. Masamori’s trap had worked.
After some time had passed, the daija awoke. It looked around, and seeing nobody it realized that Masamori had lied. Trembling with rage, the daija returned to the Shiga Highlands. It summoned all of its family, servants, and clan members. All of the spirits of the Shiga Highlands arose and summoned a great storm. Rain the likes of which had never been seen before fell. Ōnuma Lake swelled in size and burst forth, flooding everything around. All of the villages surrounding the lake were annihalated. Houses were knocked down. Fields were flooded and washed away. No humans or animals were able to escape destruction. However, the mountains around the Takanashi Masamori’s castle acted like a shield, and the castle stood firm.
Kuro hime looked down from the castle and watched the torrent wash away wash away the entire region. She heartbroken when she saw the destruction. Realizing that only she had the power to stop the disaster, she left the castle by herself and traveled down to Ōnuma Lake. Kuro hime threw herself into the flood and was never seen again. When the daija realized what had happened, it immediately scattered the storm clouds and caused the flood to recede. Ōnuma Lake shrank back to its original borders.
The daija is still worshiped today as the guardian deity of the Shiga Highlands. There is a small shrine called Daija Jinja located near Ōnuma Lake where the snake is enshrined. Every August, the villagers gather there to perform the Daija Matsuri and remember the story of Kuro hime.","Snakes have been a part of Japanese mythology since the earliest times, in part to their peculiar behaviors. Snakes are symbols of life and death, and eternal youth—the shedding and regrowing of their skin was viewed as a magical ability. Because they can slip into the tiniest cracks, and can penetrate deep, dark places that are inaccessible to humans, they are viewed as tenacious and clever creatures. Because of these traits, snakes have long been considered to be kami or yōkai. During different periods of history, they have been referred to as orochi, daija, and uwabami, but all of these refer to the same creature.",A famous tale comes from Ōnuma Lake in Nagano Prefecture.,,

They are a popular target of game fishing and are also raised in fisheries.","Amemasu spend most of their lives in the water, away from humans. They are found mostly in rivers and streams, but seagoing varieties exist as well. They are more common in Hokkaido, the northern parts of Honshu, and along the Sea of Japan—however legends of amemasu are occasionally found in the southern parts of Japan as well. They feed on whatever they can eat—from plankton to insects, to fish and any other aquatic lifeforms they can fit into their mouths. Yōkai amemasu can grow to colossal sizes, sometimes spanning an entire lake from head to tail. These giant amemasu also occasionally thrash and sink ships, devouring any poor souls who happened to be on the ship. In Ainu folklore, the wild thrashing of giant amemasu is believed to be what causes earthquakes—much like giant catfish are thought to cause earthquakes in the rest of Japan.","Amemasu can transform into human shape and walk about on land. They usually take the form of young, beautiful women in order to seduce young men. Shape-changed amemasu can be identified by their skin, which feels cold and clammy like that of a fish.","A legend from Minabe, Wakayama Prefecture tells of a mysterious whirlpool that appeared in a deep pond. A giant amemasu lived in the pond. Every spring, she would emerge from the pond in the form of a beautiful woman. For two or three days she would catch young men and take them away—where to nobody knows, but they were never seen again. The only way to know that it was a fish and not a woman was from her cold, clammy skin. One day, a cormorant dove into the pond to go hunting. The giant amemasu swallowed the bird in a single gulp. However, after a short time, the amemasu’s body floated up to the surface of the pond, dead. The cormorant burst out of its stomach. A shrine was built at that spot to honor Konpira-san, which still stands today.",,"A number of lakes in Hokkaido are believed to be the home of giant amemasu.

In China, the rabbit is believed not to be creating mochi, but is instead mixing the medicine of eternal youth.",,The Japanese word for pounding mochi in a mortar like the rabbit is doing—餅搗き (mochitsuki)—and the word for the full moon—望月 (mochitsuki)—are homophones.,"The myth of the rabbit in the moon is very ancient. The earliest written version comes from the Jātaka tales, a 4th century BCE collection of Buddhist legends written in Sanskrit. The legend was brought along with Buddhism from India to China, where it was blended with local folklore. It came to Japan in the 7th century CE from China, where it was again adapted and adjusted to fit local folklore.","The Japanese version of the Sanskrit tale appears in Konjaku monogatarishū. A fox, a monkey, and a rabbit were traveling in the mountains when they came across a shabby-looking old man lying along the road. The old man had collapsed from exhaustion while trying to cross the mountains. The three animals felt compassion for the old man, and tried to save him. The monkey gathered fruit and nuts from the trees, the fox gathered fish from the river, and they fed the old man. As hard as he tried, the rabbit, however, could not gather anything of value to give to the old man. Lamenting his uselessness, the rabbit asked the fox and monkey for help in building a fire.  When the fire was built, the rabbit leaped into the flames so that his own body could be cooked and eaten by the old man. When the old man saw the rabbit’s act of compassion, he revealed his true form as Taishakuten, one of the lords of Heaven. Taishakuten lifted up the rabbit and placed it the moon, in order that all future generations could be inspired by the rabbit’s compassionate act. The reason it is sometimes difficult to see the rabbit in the moon is because of the smoke which still billows from the rabbits body, masking his form somewhat.",,

It is found across East Asian folklore.,,,"The three-legged crow has long been used in religious and astrological symbolism across China and Japan, particularly among those involved with sun worship and onmyōdō. The three legs of the bird represent heaven, the earth, and humanity, while the crow itself represents the sun. This symbolizes that heaven, earth, and mankind all come from the same sun, and are like brothers to each other. They are also said to represent the three virtues of the gods: wisdom, benevolence, and valor. The three legs may also represent the three powerful clans of ancient Kumano—Ui, Suzuki, and Enomoto—who use a three-legged crow as their clan crest.
Jimmu’s clan originated in Kyushu, in present-day Miyazaki Prefecture. He and his brothers led an eastward migration from along the Seto Insland Sea, looking for a better homeland, and subduing the various tribes they encountered along the way. They suffered many hardships. When they reached Naniwa (present-day Osaka), Jimmu’s older brother Itsuse, leader of the expedition, was killed in battle. Jimmu realized that they had lost because they were fighting facing eastwards, fighting against the sun. He led his troops around the Kii peninsula, to Kumano (present-day Mie Prefecture), and began a westward push. His expedition became lost in the mountains of Kumano. Seeing this, Amaterasu, the sun goddess, and Takamimusubi, one of the creator gods, ordered Kamo Taketsunumi to act as a guide to Jimmu. Kamo Taketsunumi took the form of a giant crow, and flew to Jimmu’s side to show him the way. With Yatagarasu leading the way, Jimmu was able to navigate the mountains of Kumano and reach Yamato (in present-day Nara Prefecture), where he would found his capital and become Japan’s first emperor.
According to legend, Jimmu’s great-grandfather Ninigi was the grandson of Amaterasu. Thus, Jimmu, and the entire Japanese imperial line are the direct descendants of the sun goddess. Yatagarasu, as a guide to Jimmu, played a small roll with a very big impact on the future of the imperial dynasty.","A three-legged crow has been used as a symbol of the sun since neolithic times in China. It may have originated as a personification of sunspots by ancient astronomers. In Japan, the crow has also been a symbol of the sun since ancient times, appearing in Japan’s earliest written works. It is a holy creature and a servant of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. The name Yatagarasu means “eight span crow.” One “span” was the length between the outstretched thumb and middle finger—roughly 18 centimeters—but this moniker is mainly just a poetic way to say “very large.” Originally Yatagarasu was depicted with two legs, but in the 930’s CE, the Chinese myth of the three-legged crow was merged into the story of Yatagarasu. Since then, Yatagarasu and the three-legged crow have been synonymous with each other.","Yatagarasu is an important figure in the mythical history of Japanese. According to the Kojiki, Japan’s oldest written history, Yatagarasu is an incarnation of the god Kamo Taketsunumi—today enshrined in Kyoto’s Shimogamo Shrine.

Because the shell of a tortoise is like a suit of armor, Genbu is also viewed as a warrior deity. The tortoise shell is a symbol of heaven and earth, with the flat part of the lower shell representing the world and the dome of the upper shell representing the heavens. As tortoise shells were a popular tool in divination, Genbu was also viewed as having soothsaying powers and the ability to travel between the lands of the living and the dead.

The word tortoise is not used for his name, because it was also used as a slur in China. So this euphemistic name was used to refer to the Black Tortoise. His name comes from Chinese mythology, where it is with the Taoist god Xuan Wu (the Chinese pronunciation of Genbu). Xuan Wu was a prince who lived in prehistoric northern China. He lived in the mountains, far from civilization, where he studied Taoism as an ascetic. He learned that to achieve full divinity, he would have to purge both his mind and body of all impurities. While his mind had become enlightened, he still had to eat earthly food, and so sin remained in his stomach and his intestines. So he cut them out and washed them in a river to purify them. When he did this, his stomach turned into a large demon tortoise and his intestines into a demon snake. The demons began to terrorize the countryside. Xuan Wu subdued them, and instead of destroying them he allowed them to atone for their sins by serving him. They became his generals: a snake and a tortoise.

A pleasant fragrance filled the air, and it seemed that ethereal music was dancing on the winds. Something caught his eye; draped over a nearby pine branch was a robe of the most splendid fabric he had ever seen. It was made of a soft, feathery material, and was woven in fantastic colors, so he decided to take it home and keep it as a family heirloom.
Just as Hakuryō was preparing to leave, a young woman of breathtaking beauty appeared in the nude before him. She had flowers in her hair, and smelled just as beautiful as she looked. She said that he was holding her hagoromo robe, and asked him to return it. Hakuryō realized that this beautiful maiden was a tennyo. He refused to return to robe, saying it would bring good luck and fortune to his village.
The woman grew sad, and lamented that she would not be able to fly home to heaven without her robe. She dropped to her knees and cried, her tears falling like beautiful pearls into the sand. The flowers in her hair wilted. She looked up at the clouds above, and heard a flock of geese flying by, which only saddened her more as they reminded her of the celestial karyōbinga birds back home in heaven.
Hakuryō was moved by the beautiful maiden’s sadness. He told her that he would return her robe, but first she must perform a celestial dance for him. She agreed to perform the dance, but told Hakuryō that she needed her hagoromo to perform the dance. Hakuryō refused to return the robe. He thought she would just fly off to heaven without performing for him. The tennyo replied to him that deception was a part of his world, not hers, and that her kind do not lie. Hakuryō  felt shame, and returned the dress to her.
The tennyo donned her hagoromo and performed the dance of the Palace of the Moon. She was accompanied by celestial music, flutes, koto, and the wind in the pines. The moon shown through the trees and sweet fragrances filled the air. The waves grew calm and peaceful. Her long sleeves danced upon the wind, and she danced in sheer joy.

She disappeared into the mists of heaven.","Tennyo are a female-only subgroup of tennin, one of many celestial races native to Tendō.

Visually they appear no different than ordinary owls. Tatarimokke remain near the homes of the families they once belonged to. The hooting of the owls is said to actually be the sound created by the spirit of the dead baby.,,"Tatarimokke are treated with respect by the families which they haunt, just like zashiki warashi. Houses that have lost a child recently will take care of any owls that appear near their homes and treat them as if they are the spirit of the lost child. In most cases, these spirits are beloved by the families they haunt, and they do not cause any harm.","In some cases, however, tatarimokke can be dangerous to people. The souls of babies whose bodies were carelessly discarded into rivers, babies who were killed by their parents to reduce the number of mouths to feed, and even the spirits of aborted fetuses could retain a grudge against the living. People passing through the places where these resentful spirits haunt might hear eerie sounds and feel unsettling sensations, see strange phenomena like floating fireballs, or may stumble on a rock and hurt themselves.
In the most extreme cases, tatarimokke truly do bring terrible curses upon those who are perceived as having wronged them. Particularly in the case of people who were murdered in particularly violent and gruesome fashion. In these cases, the tatarimokke is not the spirit of a newborn baby, but instead is the spirit of the murder victim. These tatarimokke lay a curse their assailant so powerful that it not only brings ruin to the murderer, but to his entire family, for generations to come.
The name tatarimokke comes from tatari (curse) and moke, which means “infant” in some northern dialects. It is usually written phonetically, but is sometimes also written with characters that mean “curse” and “frog.” In this case, the character for frog is actually read as “moke,” and refers to the local word for a newborn baby.","Long ago in Japan, babies were not considered fully human until some time after they were born. Therefore, when a newborn died, it was not given a proper funeral and placed in a cemetery, but was usually buried quietly in or around the house.

It is depicted with one or both paws in the air in a beckoning motion.,,,"Statues of maneki neko became popular items in the urban areas of Japan towards the end of the Edo period. Cats with their right hand raised are said to bring economic fortune, while cats with their left hand raised are said to attract customers. The cat’s colors of the can be significant as well. Long ago, black cats were said to be lucky cats due to their ability to see in the dark, and so black maneki neko were used as talismans against evil spirits. Red was believed to repel smallpox and measles, so red maneki neko were used as talismans against sickness.
The origins of these statues lie in folkloric tales about strange cats who bring riches to their masters, or who save their masters from disaster. There are a number of famous stories based on variations of these themes.
One day, as Usugumo tried to visit the bathroom, her tortoiseshell cat began acting extremely clingy. It refused to leave her side, clawing at her dress and meowing noisily. Seeing this, the brothel owner thought that the cat was attacking Usugumo. He quickly drew his sword and slashed at the cat. The cat’s head flew through the air into the bathroom, and sunk its teeth into a large venomous snake which was hiding out of site near the toilet.
Usugumo was overcome with grief for her pet cat, which even in death had saved her life. To ease her sadness, the brothel owner had a statue in the likeness of her cat made by the finest woodcarver out of the finest wood. The carving was so masterfully done and so lifelike that Usugumo was overjoyed and was able to find her happiness once again.
Everyone who saw the carving of the cat wanted one just like it. That year, copies of the figure were sold in the Asakusa markets. This is often thought to be the origin of the maneki neko statue.
","Cats have long been connected with the supernatural in Japan. While some superstitions link cats with bad luck, curses, and strange fires, there is also a long tradition of cats being revered and seen as good creatures. Particularly in agricultural and sericulture, where cats would eat mice and other pests who attack crops and silkworms, cats were seen as lucky creatures, and images of cats were used as charms.","In the Yoshiwara please district of Edo, there lived a very famous courtesan named Usugumo. Usugumo was a tayū (the highest rank of oiran) in the esteemed brothel of Miura Yashirōzaemon.

Kuzunoha explained to Seimei that she was the white fox his father once saved. She then fled into the forest, never to return again. Kuzunoha entrusted her son to the onmyōji Kamo no Tadayuki in order to ensure that he would not grow up to be evil.
Abe no Seimei had many rivals. One of them was a famous priest from Harima named Chitoku Hōshi. Chitoku was a skilled sorcerer, and wanted to test Seimei to see if he was truly as great as people said he was. Chitoku disguised himself as a traveler and visited Seimei’s house, and asked Seimei to teach him magic. Seimei saw through the disguise instantly. Even more, he saw that the two servants Chitoku had brought with him were shikigami—summoned servant spirits—in disguise.
Seimei decided to have a little bit of fun with Chitoku. He agreed to train him, but said that it was not a good day, and that he should come back tomorrow. Chitoku went back to his home, while unbeknownst to him, Seimei unsummoned both of the shikigami. The next day, Chitoku realized that his servants were gone, and he approached Seimei to ask him to return his shikigami. Seimei laughed at him, angrily scolding him for trying to trick him. Any other person, he said, would not be so kind to return shikigami that were employed against him! Chitoku realized that he was in way over his head; not only could Seimei see through his disguise, but he was able to manipulate all of his spells as well. He bowed low, begged for forgiveness, and offered to become Seimei’s servant.
Abe no Seimei’s chief rival was a sorcerer from Harima named Ashiya Dōman. Dōman was much older than Seimei, and believed that there was no one in the land who was a better onmyōji than he was. Upon hearing of Seimei’s genius, he challenged him to a magical duel.
On the day of the competition, many officials and witnesses came to watch. The two sorcerers met in the imperial gardens for the contest. First, Dōman picked up a handful of sand, concentrated over it for a moment, and threw it into the air. The particles of sand turned into countless swallows which began to flit around the garden. Seimei waved his folding fan one time, and all of the swallows turned back into grits of sand.
Next, Seimei recited a spell. A dragon appeared in the sky above. Rain began to fall all around them. Dōman recited his spell, however as hard as he tried, he could not cause the dragon to vanish. Instead, the rain grew fiercer and fiercer, filling the garden with water up to Dōman’s waist. Finally, Seimei cast his spell again. The rain stopped, and the dragon vanished.
The third and final contest was a divination challenge: the contestants had to guess the contents of a wooden box. Dōman, indignant at having lost the previous round, challenged Seimei: “Whoever loses this round will become the other’s servant!” Dōman confidently declared that there were 15 oranges inside of the box. Seimei contradicted him, saying that there were 15 rats in the box. The emperor and his attendants who had prepared the test shook their heads, for they had put 15 oranges in the box. They announced that Seimei had lost. However, when they opened the box, 15 rats leaped out! Not only had Seimei divined the contents of the box, he had transformed the oranges into rats, tricking Dōman and the entire court. Victory went to Seimei.
Ashiya Dōman continued to hold a grudge against Abe no Seimei, and continued to plot against him. He seduced Seimei’s wife and convinced her to tell him Seimei’s magical secrets. She showed him the stone box in which Seimei kept Hoki Naiden, his book of spells. Hoki Naiden was a book of secrets which had been passed down since time immemorial from India to Tang, China. It came into the possession of the Japanese envoy, Kibi no Makibi. When Kibi no Makibi returned to Japan from Tang, he presented the secret book to the relatives of his friend Abe no Nakamaro, who remained in China. From there it was passed down and eventually inherited by Abe no Seimei.
One night when Seimei returned home, Dōman boasted that he had acquired Seimei’s secret magic book. Seimei scolded him, saying that was impossible. So impossible, in fact, that if Dōman did have the book, he could cut Seimei’s throat. Dōman triumphantly presented the book, and Seimei, realizing that he had been betrayed by his wife, offered his throat to Dōman. Dōman gladly cut it open. Seimei died.
When Seimei was murdered, Saint Hokudō—the Chinese wizard who had given Hoki Naiden to Kibi no Makibi—sensed the loss of a great sorcerer. He traveled across the sea to Japan, collected Seimei’s bones, and restored Abe no Seimei to life. The pair of them set out to get revenge on Dōman and Seimei’s ex-wife, who was now married to Dōman.
Saint Hokudō paid a visit to Seimei’s home, where Dōman and his wife were now living. He asked if Abe no Seimei was home, to which Dōman replied that, unfortunately, Abe no Seimei had been murdered some time ago. Saint Hokudō said that was impossible, for he had just seen Seimei earlier that day. Dōman laughed at him, saying that was impossible. So impossible, in fact, that if Seimei was actually alive, he could cut Dōman’s throat. Saint Hokudō called out to Abe no Seimei, who presented himself. He then promptly cut open the throats of Ashiya Dōman and his wife.
Today, Abe no Seimei is worshipped as a god at many shrines throughout Japan. His main shrine is located in Kyōto, and sits on the site of his former house.","Abe no Seimei’s fame comes from the success he had as an onmyōji in the 10th century. He was a student of Kamo no Tadayuki and Kamo no Yasunori, and succeeded Yasunori as astrologer and diviner for the imperial court. Seimei’s duties included foreseeing the gender of unborn babies, diving the location of objects, advising on matters of personal conduct, conducting exorcisms and crafting wards against dark magic and evil spirits, and analyzing and interpreting events such as celestial phenomena. He wrote numerous books on divination and fortune telling, including Senji Ryakketsu, containing six thousand forecast and thirty-six fortune telling techniques using shikigami, and a translation of Hoki Naiden, detailing secret divination techniques.","It was believed that Abe no Seimei’s magical aptitude derived from a supernatural lineage. His mother was said to be a kitsune, making him half-yōkai. Seimei’s father, Abe no Yasuna, saved a white fox which was being chased by hunters. The fox transformed into a beautiful human woman and said her name was Kuzunoha. Out of thanks for saving her life, Kuzunoha became Yasuna’s wife and bore him a son, Seimei.",,

It is jealously guarded by the few who know it, and strongly coveted by those who don’t.",,,"The Abe clan was famous for their knowledge of this spell. It is one of the reasons they were able to maintain a monopoly on the imperial Bureau of Onmyōdō. Under their offices, this spell was routinely performed for the emperors in order to increase their life spans and protect the country.
Once, a high ranking monk of Mii-dera known as Chikō fell gravely ill. It was determined that his illness was the result of karma, and thus could not be cured with medicine. Abe no Seimei was summoned. He divined Chikō’s fortune, and discovered that death was imminent. However, Abe no Seimei said that if someone was willing to trade life spans with Chikō, he could perform the Taizan Fukun no Sai and save the priest’s life.
The priests all looked at each other uncomfortably. As much as they loved and admired Chikō, nobody was willing to sacrifice his own life in order to save him. Finally, a young man named Shōkū—an average pupil who had been studying for many years yet had never attracted the attention of Chikō or the other teachers—stepped forward and offered his own life.
Abe no Seimei accepted the offer. He immediately performed the Taizan Fukun no Sai. Shōkū writhed in anguish, his life span shrinking away, while Chikō rapidly began to recover. Finally, Chikō was cured, and Shōkū lay on death’s door. As the young pupil’s last breath left his body, he prayed with all his heart to a nearby painting of Fudō Myōō. Just then, tears poured from the painted eyes of Fudō Myōō, and the god’s voice was heard:
“If you would take the place of your teacher, then let me take your place instead.”
Suddenly, Shōkū and Chikō sat up, both of then restored to life.","This spell was developed in ancient China by Taoist philosophers. It is named for Lord Taizan, the god of the mountain Taishan in Shandong, China and one of the kings of hell. He is one of the most important deities in Onmyōdō. In this ritual, the supplicant beseeches Lord Taizan, Great King Enma, and the other judges of Meido and Jigoku to lengthen a person’s life span, save someone from death, or even restore life to the dead. Gold, silver, silk, saddled horses, and human life—usually substitutes in the form of katashiro, or paper dolls—are offered to the gods. No mantras or magical worlds are spoken; the gods are simply invited to sit down and participate. A formal letter of request is read to them, detailing the offerings and the virtues of the supplicants, and the precise divine intervention desired.","Abe no Seimei is particularly famous for his use of Taizan Fukun no Sai.

These animals normally grow up to one and a half meters long, however the yōkai versions of this animal can grow much larger. They have rough, mottled, brown and black skin, tiny eyes, and enormous mouths which span the entire width of their heads. They live in rivers and streams far from human-inhabited areas.",,"Hanzaki and humans rarely come into contact with each other. When they do, it is usually because the hanzaki has grown large enough to eat humans or livestock and is causing trouble to nearby villagers.","During the first year of Bunroku (1593 CE), the villagers called for help, asking if there was anyone brave enough to slay the hanzaki. A young villager named Miura no Hikoshirō volunteered. Hikoshirō grabbed his sword and dove into the pool. He did not come back up; he had been swallowed by the hanzaki in a single gulp! Moments later, Hikoshirō sliced through the hanzaki and tore it in half from the inside out, killing it instantly. The slain creature’s body was 10 meters long, and 5 meters in girth!
The very day the hanzaki was slain, strange things began to happen at the Miura residence. Night after night, something would bang on the door, and something screaming and crying could be heard just outside the door. However, when Hikoshirō opened the door to check, there was nothing there at all.
Not long after that, Hikoshirō and his entire family died suddenly. Strange things began to happen through the village as well. The villagers believed the angry ghost of the dead hanzaki had cursed them. They built a small shrine and enshrined the hanzaki’s spirit as a god, dubbing it Hanzaki Daimyōjin. After that, the hanzaki’s spirit was pacified, and the curse laid to rest.
A gravestone dedicated to Miura no Hikoshirō still stands in Yubara, Okayama Prefecture. The villagers of Yubara still honor Hanzaki Daimyōjin by building giant salamander shrine floats and parading them through town during the annual Hanzaki Festival.
","The name hanzaki is a colloquialism for the Japanese giant salamander. They are called hanzaki for their regenerative powers; it was believed that a salamander’s body could be cut (saku) in half (han) and it would still survive. The call of the salamander was said to resemble that of a human baby, and so the word is written with kanji combining fish (魚) and child (兒).","There was once a deep pool in which a gigantic hanzaki lived. The hanzaki would grab horses, cows, and even villagers, drag them into the pool, and swallow them in a single gulp. For generations, the villagers lived in fear of the pool and stayed away from it.",,
https://yokai.com/meido/,Meido,冥途,めいど,dark way; the underworld,,,,"When someone dies, they either go to Tengoku (heaven) or Jigoku (hell). If they lived an exceptionally good or an exceptionally evil life, they may go straight to Tengoku or Jigoku. However, for most people—who have done both and good and evil in their lives—the soul travels to Meido. There they face a test by the judges of the dead, each of whose true form is that of a buddha or a god. They are then sent either to Tengoku or Jigoku. Meido is a terrible place—though nowhere near as terrible as Jigoku. It is dark, windy, and full of horrible sights, sounds, tests and trials. It is a long journey, with no place to rest or find comfort.",,There are many variations on what exactly happens after this life ends. These are often depicted in graphic hell scrolls kept at temples. The depictions differ greatly from tradition to tradition and place to place. A typical explanation may go like this:,"To enter the underworld, the soul much first find and cross the Sanzu River, the River of Three Crossings, which marks the boundary between this world and the world of the dead. The Sanzu River is said to be located somewhere on Mount Osore, literally Mount Fear, a desolate volcano located in northern Japan. Despite its appearance—covered in blasted rocks, bubbling pits of dark liquid, and open vents spewing out toxic gas—Mount Osore is one of the three holiest places in Japan. Itako, blind shamanesses, communicate with the dead as they approach the mountain.
Upon dying, souls are visited by three oni who escort them on a seven day journey to Meido. The journey is harsh and terrible. It is dark, and a strong, howling wind rages constantly. The corruption of the living world materializes into swords on this plane, which pierce the bodies of the travelers, turning the surrounding terrain into a sea of blood.
A few days along the way, the souls are assaulted by horrible birds, which tear at their skin and pluck out their eyes. All the while the birds taunt them and scream at them to hurry up. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner? I would have hurried from the start!” cry the souls of the dead. “What is this stupid soul saying!” cry the birds. “We were perched on his roof since three days before he died, warning him to start saying his prayers! That fool only said, ‘The crows are being extra noisy today. The old woman next door must be dying. Go bring her some sugar.’ Well the old woman is still alive, happily licking her sugar!”
Next, the souls come to an enormous mountain which scrapes the clouds, covered in sharp thorns. The path up the mountain is steep and impossibly long. The souls cry out, “I was sick and weak in life, how can you expect me to climb such a mountain now?” To which the oni reply, “What is this stupid soul saying! This is the mountain of your greed! Every time you wanted something your neighbor owned, or desired some earthly possession, you added to this mountain! You built it, now you can climb it!” Anyone who lags behind gets hit with the oni’s terrible iron club.
Finally, after seven days, the souls arrive at the Sanzu River and face the first trial put forth by the first judge, King Shinkō (whose true form is that of Fudō Myōō; who is known as Acala in English). Shinkō judges the souls on how much killing they have committed, down to every bug that was squashed and every fish that was caught. Those whom Shinkō judges to be wicked go straight to Jigoku. Others may cross the river depending on how well they fared in the trial. To cross the Sanzu River, a toll of 6 mon (an old form of currency) is required. This is buried with the deceased during the funeral. Those whose funerals were not properly performed and did not receive the 6 mon cannot cross. This is the reason that the seventh day after death is an important day in Japanese funerary services. The services and prayers performed for the deceased aid them in this trial and allow them to cross the river.
One part of the Sanzu River is crossed by a great bridge. Another part of the river is shallow and fordable. The rest of the river is wild and deep, and filled with poisonous snakes. The souls with the most good deeds are allowed to cross the bridge. Those with a mixture of both good and evil may ford the river in the shallow part. The worst of the souls may only cross by swimming through snake-filled rapids. The crossing of the Sanzu River takes seven days.
After crossing the river, the souls encounter Datsueba and Keneō. These two oni take the heavy clothes from each soul, wet from the crossing of the river, and hang them on a tree. The amount the branch bends under the weight of the clothes serves as a measure of the weight of the sin on each soul, to be used as evidence in the trials to come. If a soul arrives with no clothes—perhaps having discarded them while swimming in the river—Datsueba flays his or her skin and hangs it from the tree instead.
The second trial takes place fourteen days after death, and is overseen by King Shokō (whose true form is Shaka Nyōrai, or Siddhartha Gautama). Shokō judges the souls on how much they have stolen. As with the previous trial, he sends the most grievous offenders straight to hell, while allowing the good to pass on to the next trial. Again, the fourteenth day after death is an important day for family members to perform ceremonies in honor of the deceased, in order to help him or her pass this trial.
Before the third trial, each soul must pass through a fortified gate which is guarded by a fierce oni. The oni wields large blades, which he uses to haphazardly chop off the arms and legs of the souls, saying, “That hand helped you to sin. I’ll cut if off for you!” The souls must then cross an enormous bay, wider than the Sanzu River, and filled with boiling liquid. The river gives off foul smelling fumes in all directions for many miles.
The third trial takes place 21 days after death, and is overseen by King Sōtei (whose true form is Manji Bosatsu, or Manjusri). Sōtei judges the souls on their sins of lust and sexuality, using a cat and a snake. The cat judges the souls of men; it bites at their penises, and the degree of the injury—from a slight scratch to completely severed—is used as a measure of one’s sexual sin. The snake judges the souls of women; it is inserted into the woman, and the depth to which it can enter is used to determine the depth of her sin. As before, some will go on to hell, while others—with the aid of funerary services from their surviving family members—will pass on to the next trial.
The fourth trial, 28 days after death, is overseen by King Gokan (whose true form is Fugen Bosatsu, or Samantabhadra). Gokan judges the dead on the number of lies they told in life. He weighs each soul against a large, heavy stone. The number of stones it takes the balance the scale determines the weight of one’s sins. Excessive liars are damned—those who are not may continue on to be judged again. Once again, the family holds a funerary service to aid their beloved departed in this trial, hoping to sway the mercy of the judge.
Next, the souls must cross a vast blasted, desolate landscape of unfathomable length. Balls of red-hot iron fall constantly like rain from the sky, burning the skin of the souls and causing their feet to blister as they walk the path to the next trial.
The fifth trial, 35 days after death, is overseen by Great King Enma, the ruler of the underworld (whose true form is that of Jizō Bosatsu, or Ksitigarbha). Enma’s judgment is the final chance to appeal one’s fate through the prayers and memorial services performed by the living relatives. Enma shows each soul a large mirror, in which the individual’s former life is reflected back at them, with all of their sins and transgressions clearly laid out. Enma’s job is to decide, based on his and the previous trials, which of the six Buddhist realms each soul will be reborn into: the realm of heaven, the realm of humans, the realm of ashura, the realm of beasts, the realm of gaki (or hungry ghosts), or the realm of hell.
After 42 days, the souls which have made it this far now face the judgment of King Henjō (whose true form is Miroku Bosatsu, or Maitreya). Henjō decides the location of each soul’s rebirth based on the reports from Enma’s mirror and Gokan’s scale.
Next, the souls must cross a dark land, full of strange animals whose cries pierce the darkness and fill the atmosphere with dread. Strange birds attack the souls, breathing flames at them and piercing them with their sharp beaks.
On the 49th day after death, the souls reach the trial of King Taizan (whose true form is Yakushi Nyōrai, or Bhaisajyaguru). The 49th day memorial service is an important one, with many family members attending to pray for the deceased; Taizan’s trial is the final chance to avoid going to hell. He uses the information from the previous judges to determine the remaining conditions of each soul’s rebirth.
Upon completion of this trial, each soul moves on to a road with six unmarked torii gates, each representing one of the Buddhist realms. There is no way to tell which gate leads to which realm, and each soul must decide for him or herself which gate to choose. Upon passing through the gate, the soul travels along an enormous frozen river, and leaves Meido for the next world, whichever one it may be. For many, the journey ends here. Those who have been judged worthy may find themselves in Tengoku. Others are reborn as humans, animals, or worse. For those deemed unworthy for even the lowest forms of rebirth, more trials await in the realm of Jigoku.","The origins of Meido are strongly rooted in Chinese Buddhism. When Buddhism was brought from India to China it took on a structure of its own, merging many aspects with Chinese philosophy and Taoism. This mixture of Chinese Taoism and Indian Buddhism was imported to Japan, after which it began to develop its own uniquely Japanese features as well.",,,

He is served by two secretaries, Shiroku and Shimyō, as well as a number of other demonic servants—the chiefs of which are Gozu and Mezu. His name often is invoked by parents who scold their children, “If you tell a lie, Enma will rip out your tongue!”","Enma’s chief duty is to judge the souls of the newly dead and send them on to their next location. He keeps a great scroll in which he records all of the good and evil deeds of each and every person to use as evidence against them when their time of judgment comes. He oversees the torturing and suffering in hell, making sure that each soul gets enough punishment.",,"Enma’s origins lie in India. In Vedic mythology he is known as Yama, the god of death. From the Vedas, the idea of Yama spread into Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. Buddhism traveled to China, bringing Yama with it, and mixed with local religions and superstitions before being brought to Japan during the Tang Dynasty. As Chinese Buddhism mixed with Japanese religions and superstitions, he gradually developed into the god known as Great King Enma.","Like many demonic figures in Japanese folklore, Great King Enma has a honji, or “true form,” which is that of a Buddha or bodhisattva. Enma’s true form is Jizō Bosatsu, the guardian of the underworld, god of travelers, and protector of children. Jizō is a warm and compassionate, beloved across Japan, deity who made a solemn vow not to become a full Buddha until all souls have been freed from suffering in hell. It is not uncommon to see small, red-bibbed, stone Jizō statues along roads and paths, and in graveyards all over Japan. While Enma may seem fearsome and terrifying, at heart, he is a kind and compassionate god, and he truly wishes to save each soul from damnation—this may be why the souls of the dead are given so many tests and trials to avoid going to hell.",,,

Datsueba and Keneō perform a little bit of torture themselves, breaking the fingers of those guilty of theft, and so on. They also roam the banks of the river, tormenting the souls of children who are too young to cross the river and must wait for salvation to come to them instead.
According to some accounts, Datsueba is the wife of King Enma. In the Edo period, she became a popular object of folk worship, and temples dedicated to her began to spring up around Japan. Prayers and charms dedicated to Datsueba were used as wards against disease and coughs, in particular for children’s coughs.",,,,

He is famous for being clever, quick-witted, and somewhat insolent. But he is even more famous for his side job in hell as an attendant to Great King Enma.",,,"According to one legend, a nobleman named Fujiwara no Yoshimi fell very ill and died soon after. His soul crossed the Sanzu River, and traveled to Meido to be judged. When he reached the court of King Enma, a familiar voice spoke up from the darkness next to the judge and said, “I know this soul. In life, he served as an imperial minister, and was a noble and virtuous man. Please trust my judgment and return him to life.” When Yoshimi raised his head, he saw that the voice belonged to Ono no Takamura—and he was serving as one of King Enma’s councilors! King Enma replied, “Well, if you say so I suppose it can’t be helped,” and ordered his hell-guards to return Yoshimi to the world of the living.
A few days later, Fujiwara no Yoshimi approached Ono no Takamura at the imperial court. When Yoshimi asked Takamura about what he saw in Meido, Takamura appeared troubled and replied, “My work there is actually a secret, so please don’t tell anybody else about what you saw…” Afterwards, Yoshimi began to grow more and more fearful of Takamura’s power and position. Rumors spread through the capital that Takamura was King Enma’s right hand man. Many feared him.
Rokudōchinnō-ji still stands in Kyōto today. In the Enma Hall, right next to the statue of Great King Enma is another statue—one of Ono no Takamura. The well which Takamura used to enter the world of the dead still remains on the temple garden; however Sagano Fukusei-ji no longer stands, and the place where Takamura’s exit well once stood is now a bamboo forest.",,"Near the temple Rokudōchinnō-ji in Kyōto, there is a spot where the boundary between the world of the dead and the world of the living can be crossed. There are many stories in that area of ghosts returning to this world and trying to buy candy from stores, or visiting lost relatives. Ono no Takamura knew of this, and discovered a way to travel freely between the world of the dead and the world of the living. He would enter the underworld every night by climbing down a well located in the garden of Rokudōchinnō-ji, and return every morning by climbing out of a well located in the temple Sagano Fukusei-ji.",,
https://yokai.com/jigoku/,Jigoku,地獄,じごく,earth prison; hell,,,,"Souls who are deemed unworthy of rebirth in the five upper Buddhist realms find themselves in the worst afterlife of all—Jigoku, or Buddhist hell. Though it is described as one realm, Jigoku is not just one place. There are countless different hells, which are usually separated into eight hot hells and eight cold hells. These are further subdivided into many other smaller planes and demi-planes—more than 64,000 according to some counts—and each one has a uniquely specialized form of punishment and length of stay, tailor-made to the sins of its inhabitants. While there are many different levels of hell in Japanese Buddhism, the general term Jigoku usually refers to the eight hot hells, also known as the eight great hells. The eight great hells are as follows:",,"Because Jigoku is so terrible and the buddhas so merciful, the tortured souls in Jigoku are allowed a few more trials like the ones they received in Meido to see whether they can be released from hell early or not—or at least have their existence “upgraded” to a less torturous one. On specific days, Buddhist memorial services are held by the deceased’s surviving relatives. While the specifics of what exactly happens in Jigoku vary between different Buddhist traditions, this is one explanation of the trials:","Tōkatsu Jigoku, the reviving hell, is the plane of hell reserved for those who commit the sin of killing. Those who kill without remorse go to this hell. Even the killing of lesser creatures such as mosquitoes, flies, or ants—unless repented—will cause a soul to go to this hell. In addition, people who were particularly pugilistic in life, and those who died in mutiny or uprisings will also fall into this hell. Here, the ground is ever hot and burning. Denizens of this hell must fight each other with iron claws, tearing each other to pieces. Terrible oni roam the land, smashing, and pulverizing souls with their iron clubs. As soon as a soul dies, a cool breeze blows and it is instantly revived, and must fight to the death again. Souls here experience the pain of being killed countless times, for a life span in the reviving hell lasts 500 years. However, time in hell is measured differently than in the world of the living: one day in this hell is equivalent to 500 years in the realm of the Four Heavenly Kings, while one day there is equivalent to 50 years on earth. Therefore, a soul in Tōkatsu Jigoku must continue this punishment for over 1.6 trillion human years.
Kokujō Jigoku, the hell of black threads, is reserved for those who have not only killed but also committed the sin of theft. Here, oni knock the souls onto the hot ground and mark lines on their body with black threads. Then, using axes and saws, the bodies are hacked to pieces along the markings made by the threads. Others are made to carry heavy piles of hot iron across a tightrope suspended over a giant frying pan. When the victims fall, they are boiled and hacked to pieces in the pan. One life span here lasts a thousand years; however, a day in this hell is equivalent to 1000 years in the realm of Tōriten, while one day in Tōriten is equivalent to 100 years in the human realm. This works out to about 13.3 trillion human years.
Shugō Jigoku, the crushing hell, is reserved for sinners who have killed, stolen, and also committed the sin of lewdness. The suffering here is ten times greater than that of Kokujō Jigoku. Denizens here are crushed repeatedly between mountains of iron, being pulverized into a bloody jelly. When the mountains separate, life is restored and the process begins again. Trees with razor-like leaves dot the landscape, and beautiful men and women beckon to the souls from the tree tops. The lustful inhabitants climb the trees, slicing their bodies up in the process, and when they reach the treetops the beautiful men and women reappear at the bottoms of the trees, beckoning them back down. As blood and severed organs spout from the bodies, giant demons and beasts rush in to gobble of their entrails and pound the souls into a bloody mush. Fellators have their tongues stretched out and nailed to their ears. Pedophiles have molten copper pumped into their anuses until it pours out of their mouths. Homosexuals see their lovers covered in flames, and are forced to embrace them, only to be burned and torn into pieces themselves. Souls remain here for 2000 years; however, one day here lasts 2000 years in the realm of Yamaten, and one day in Yamaten lasts 200 human years. Thus, a lifetime here is equivalent to over 106 trillion human years.
Kyōkan Jigoku, the screaming hell, is for murders, thieves, lechers, and alcoholics. The suffering here is ten times stronger than in the previous hell. Here, sinners are thrown into boiling pots or locked up in iron chambers and roasted by oni. Those who committed crimes while drunk have their mouths wrenched open and molten iron is poured into their bellies. The cries of anguish of the denizens only serve to anger the oni further, and they fire arrows at the souls or bash them with iron clubs to make them stop, at which point they only revive and resume their suffering. One lifetime here lasts 4000 years, of which one day is equal to 4000 years in Tosotsuten, of which one day is equal to 400 human years. Thus, a condemned soul will spend over 852 trillion years in Kyōkan Jigoku.
Daikyōkan Jigoku, the hell of great screaming, contains murderers, thieves, debauchers, drunks, and liars. The suffering inflicted here is ten times worse than in the previous hell. Here, the tongues of the damned are pierced with iron nails and stretched and torn from their bodies, after which they grow back and are immediately pierced and torn again. This continues for 8000 years, one day of which equals 8000 years in Kerakuten, where one day is equivalent to 800 human years. The damned in Daikyōkan Jigoku suffer for an equivalent of roughly 6.8 quadrillion years.
Jōnetsu Jigoku, the burning hell, contains killers, robbers, perverts, drunkards, liars, and those who have held thoughts or beliefs contrary to Buddhist teachings. Here, the tortured souls are beaten with red-hot iron clubs. They have hot skewers thrust through their mouths and out their anuses, and are broiled over a great sea of fire. A life span in this hell lasts 16,000 years, one day of which equals 16,000 years in Takejizaiten, where one day is equivalent to 1,600 years on earth. A damned soul here spends the equivalent of 54.5 quadrillion human years.
Daijōnetsu Jigoku, the hell of great burning, is much the same as Jōnetsu Jigoku, only much hotter. The suffering here is equivalent to ten times more than all of the higher hells combined. This plane of hell is reserved for sinners who have committed all of the crimes listed previously in addition to physical crimes against Buddhist clergy—for example, raping a nun. The screams of the tortured souls here are so terrible that they can be heard up to 24,000 miles away. The power of this hell is so great that those who are to be sentenced here begin to feel their suffering up to three days before they actually die. The punishment on this level of hell lasts one half of an antarakalpa—a unit of time in Indian cosmology that is so unfathomably long that it defies mathematical description.
Mugen Jigoku, the hell of uninterrupted suffering, is the eighth and deepest circle of hell. It is reserved for the worst of the worst—murders of their own parents; killers of saints; those who have betrayed every single Buddhist precept. The souls down here are so hungry and thirsty that they tear apart their own bodies and drink their own blood in a useless attempt to ease their suffering. Words literally cannot describe how awful this hell is; if Mugen Jigoku were ever accurately described, both the reader and the writer would die from the sheer horror of it. It is so deep that it takes 2000 years of falling, non-stop, at terminal velocity, for a soul to descend all the way into this hell. Some say that those who are sent here never come back, while others say that the term of punishment here lasts one full antarakalpa, after which the soul may reincarnate again; although, even after a soul is finally released from this hell, its punishment is said to continue on into its next lives.
100 days after death marks the first trial in Jigoku. These trials are not so much judgments, as the soul is already being tortured in hell. They are more like appeals, where the soul (and his or her still-living family) get to appeal to the gods and the buddhas for one more chance at salvation. During the first of these trials, the soul is brought before King Byōdō (whose true form is Kannon Bosatsu, also known as Guanyin or Avalokitesvara in English).
On the 1 year anniversary of the death, the soul is once again brought to trial. This time the judge is King Toshi (whose true form is Seishi Bosatsu, or Mahasthamaprapta).
On the 2nd year anniversary of one’s death (the beginning of the third year after death), the soul is granted another chance for salvation by trial. King Godō-tenrin (whose true form is Amida Nyōrai, or Amitabha) presides over this judgment. In Chinese Buddhism, this tenth trial is the last chance for salvation; however, in some forms of Japanese Buddhism the soul still gets three more chances for salvation from Jigoku.
The next trial occurs 6 years after death, and is presided over by King Renge (whose true form is Ashuku Nyōrai, or Akshobhya).
Another trial occurs 12 years after death, and is presided over by King Gion (whose true form is Dainichi Nyōrai, or Vairocana).
The thirteenth and final trial occurs 32 years after death. This last trial is presided over by King Houkai (whose true form is Kokūzō Bosatsu, or Akasagarbha). Those who fail all three of these final tests, either through their own faults or from lack of prayers by their living relatives, are damned to remain in hell for a very, very long time before they can be reborn into one of the five other realms.","Like Meido, the Japanese concept of Jigoku derives from Chinese Buddhism—specifically the concept of Diyu, which is in turn derived from the Indian Buddhist concept of Naraka.

They are well known for their skill at weaving, and they spend much of their lives working on their looms. The sea silk that they weave is of the finest quality and doesn’t get wet even in the water. They are very emotional, and cry frequently. When they cry, pearls (or precious gems, by some accounts) fall from their eyes instead of tears.",,"Tōtarō pitied the samebito. He took the samebito back to his home, where he had a small garden with a pond. He told the samebito that he could live there for as long as he wanted, and he could have as much food as he wanted to eat. For six months they lived together, and every day Tōtarō brought the samebito fresh food fit for a sea creature.
During the seventh month, Tōtarō went to a festival at Mii-dera, where a great pilgrimage of women had come. There, he met a woman of extraordinary beauty and refinement, with skin as white as snow, and a voice like a nightingale. Her name was Tamana, and Tōtarō fell in love with her at first sight. Totaro followed Tamana home, and discovered that she lived in the same town in which he had met the samebito. He also learned that she was unmarried, and that her family wanted her to marry a man of rank. They demanded as a betrothal gift a casket of ten thousand jewels from whomever wished to marry Tamana.
Tōtarō fell into despair, knowing that even if there were ten thousand jewels in all of Japan, he would never be able to procure them. Though it seemed impossible that he could ever make Tamana his wife, he could not get her lovely face and sweet voice out of his mind. It haunted him so much that he refused to eat or sleep, and became so ill that he could not even lift his head from his pillow. It seemed that he would die of a broken heart. The samebito, whom Tōtarō had cared for in his time of despair, entered the house to care for Tōtarō in his last days. Tōtarō apologized to the samebito, fearing that after his death, the samebito would lose his home and his means of survival, and would die as well. The samebito was so touched by Tōtarō’s compassion that he began to cry. Great tears of blood spilled from his green eyes and down his black cheeks, but by the time they hit the floor they had hardened into splendid rubies.
At this sight, Tōtarō instantly found new strength, and began to gather the jewels. The samebito, astonished at Tōtarō’s recovery, stopped crying. Of course, the flow of jewels also stopped. Tōtarō begged the samebito to continue crying until he had ten thousand jewels, but the samebito regretfully replied that he could only weep when he felt true grief in his heart. Seeing that Tōtarō’s sickness was cured, the samebito was filled with nothing but relief, and thus could not cry anymore. The samebito suggested that they visit the bridge where they had first met to reminisce, and perhaps he could cry again.
The next day, Tōtarō and the samebito visited the bridge. They ate fish and drank wine, and watched the setting sun. Seeing the sun set over the sparkling sea, and with a little help from the wine, the samebito thought about his former life in the sea and his happy days in the dragon palace. He was overcome with homesickness and began to weep profusely. A great shower of jewels covered the bridge. Tōtarō began gathering them up. When he had collected ten thousand jewels he shouted for joy. At the same moment, a delightful song was heard far away in the sea. Like a cloud, a glorious palace made of coral the color of the setting sun rose out of the water. The samebito leaped with joy. He explained to Tōtarō that the Eight Great Dragon Kings must have granted him amnesty and were calling him back home. He bade his farewell to Tōtarō, thankful for his kindness and their friendship, and then dove into the sea.
Tōtarō never saw the samebito again. He brought the casket of ten thousand jewels to Tamana’s family and presented them as a betrothal gift. Shortly after, Tōtarō and Tamana were married.","The kōjin is better known in the West by the alternate reading of its kanji—samebito. This is because of Lafcadio Hearn, who included a story about a samebito in his book of Japanese folk tales, Shadowings.","Long ago, a man named Tawaraya Tōtarō lived on the shore of Lake Biwa. One day, he came across a strange looking creature crouching near the base of a bridge. It resembled a man, but its body was inky black, it had the face of a demon and the beard of a dragon, and its eyes were like green emeralds. Although Tōtarō was scared, the green eyes seemed gentle to him, and so he approached the creature. The creature introduced himself as a samebito. He had served as an officer under the Eight Great Dragon Kings in the dragon palace of Ryūgū-jō, but was banished from the palace and exiled from the sea due to a small mistake he had made. Since then, he had been wandering, unable to find food or shelter. He begged Tōtarō for help.",,

When a giant triton reaches an age of several thousand years old, it turns into a draconic creature called a shussebora.","Long ago, it was believed that giant tritons lived deep in the mountains. They spend their lives buried under the earth. They grow larger and larger, until after three thousand years they descend from the mountains into the valleys during landslides. They spend three thousand more years living near human villages, until they finally burrow into the sea. After three thousand more years underwater, they transform into a mizuchi—a kind of sea dragon.","Because they spend their years buried in the earth or deep in the sea, shussebora very rarely ever interact with people. However, the caves they leave behind during their migrations serve as a testament to their existence. All over Japan, after landslides people have discovered large caves which shussebora were thought to have lived in. These discoveries were even documented in newspapers during the Meiji period.","Diet:
The flesh of a shussebora was said to bring very long life to anyone who eats it. However, as there is no documented evidence of this, and nobody who has actually eaten a shussebora has come forth, this is thought to be just rumor.","Because of the ambiguous nature of these creatures—the rumors about their life-giving meat, and the lack of any evidence other the caves they allegedly lived in—the phrase “hora wo fuku” (“to blow a conch shell”), meaning “to brag,” is said to have originated from this yōkai.",,,

In the autumn, they bear face-shaped fruit which tastes sweet and sour.",,"If a person laughs at the tree, the head-shaped flowers will laugh back at that person. If they laugh too strongly, the heads will wilt and fall off the trees.","Ninmenju first appears in Japan in the Edo period encyclopedia Wakan sansai zue, which documents animals, plants, and yōkai from both inside and outside of Japan. The description is paraphrased from the Sancai tuhui, a Chinese encyclopedia published in 1609. Sancai tuhui describes ninmenju as originating in the foreign land of Daishi-koku (大食国). Daishi was the Japanese pronunciation of the Ming Chinese name for the Islamic world, which came from the Persian word tāzī. Tāzī was the Persian word for Muslims, derived from the Tayy, an Arabic tribe which flourished under the Abbasid Caliphate.
The waq waq tree of Islamic folklore is very similar to the ninmenju. This tree was described as bearing fruit shaped like humans and animals. The fruit could speak, but would die a few days after being picked. These trees grew on the mythical island of Waq Waq in the land of Zanj, an area in Africa near present-day Zanzibar. Legend has it that Alexander the Great had his death foretold by one of these trees. The waq waq tree may be the same tree from Daishi-koku that the Sancai Tuhui refers to. Through trade between Ming China along the Silk Road, it is possible that this Arabic myth is the model for what eventually became the ninmenju.",The ninmenju is an example of folklore that has traveled over great time and distance to become what it is.,,,

As the sun’s rays pierce the dark forests, strange shapes no longer hide among the trees. The time of meeting evil spirits is over. Once again the world is safe for humans.",,,"In Japanese artwork, the sun often appears as the final scene in picture scrolls depicting yōkai and the night parade of one hundred demons. Similarly, Toriyama Sekien’s second illustrated yōkai encyclopedia, Konjaku gazu zoku hyakki, opens with ōmagatoki and closes with hinode, depicting the monsters that rule the world from dusk until dawn.","The sun has always been a central part of Japanese religion. Amaterasu, the sun goddess, is the most important deity in Shinto and is worshipped across Japan.

It is not quite day, but not quite night. Shadows swallow everything. Your eyes start to play tricks on your mind. The border thins between sekai—the world we live in, belong to, and recognize—and ikai, the “other” world. Ikai is where the spirits live, a world about which we humans know next to nothing. During ōmagatoki, the evil spirits, the chimimōryō, wake up and move about freely. This is the hour when yōkai, yūrei, and other dark things cross over into our world.",,"Humans and spirits normally have separate existences in different worlds. When those worlds come together, things become chaotic—particularly for humans. In order to avoid meeting the things that prowl the night, people would head home as the sun set and stay inside until morning. Woodcutters sleeping in mountain huts something heard the cutting down of trees at night, but found no evidence of it in the morning. Phantom waterfalls could be heard where there was no waterfall for miles around. Strange laughter and voices of inhuman things echoed throughout the forests. Children who wandered away from the village and got lost in the mountains could be spirited away by otherworldly things and taken to another world. Sometimes they would return years later, changed in some way.","The appearance of yōkai during ōmagatoki is said to be accompanied by a few telltale signs: a cold wind blowing; a strange smell in the air, like that of fish or blood; a sudden onset of darkness; a sudden chill that causes one’s hairs to stand on end.
Ōmagatoki can be written two different ways: 逢魔時 literally means the hour of meeting evil spirits; 大禍時 literally means the hour of great calamity. Both of these readings illustrate the fear and apprehension that the ancient Japanese people felt towards the things that came at twilight.","The first tales of encounters between humans and spirits came from woodsmen, travelers, criminals, and people whose livelihoods forced them away from the safety of their homes and villages at night. These men would return to their villages in the morning with stories of eerie experiences after twilight. Over time, these stories developed into the earliest superstitions, helping shape Japanese folklore, religion, and society into what they are today.",,,

Onikuma continue growing and reach sizes much larger than even the largest natural bears. They walk on two legs and are large enough to carry off cows and horses, and can easily move aside boulders than ten men could not budge. They are so powerful that they can even crush a monkey with the palm of their hand.","Onikuma behavior is very similar to that of ordinary bears. They live deep in the mountains, far away from humans. They are nocturnal. They hunt and scavenge and are able to eat just about anything. They rarely venture out of their habitats, but like ordinary bears, will occasionally emerge from the forests into villages to look for food.","Due to their reclusive nature, encounters between onikuma and humans are very rare. When they do happen, however, they are often violent. Onikuma sometimes wander into human-inhabited areas when there is easy food to be had—this usually means livestock. Onikuma are capable of stealing cows and horses and walking off into the forest with them in hand. When this happens, the villagers have no choice but to try to hunt and kill the onikuma.","To hunt an onikuma, special tactics are required. First, hunters use strong timber to build a sturdy wooden structure resembling a square well casing. This is covered with wisteria vines and inserted to plug up the entrance of the onikuma’s den. Then, sticks and brush are pushed in through the narrow openings around the den plug. The onikuma will pull these things into the den and pile them up in the back, like a nest. As more and more are inserted, the den will fill up until there is no more space, and the onikuma will push its way out through the vine-covered plug. Then, it is stabbed with a long spear and shot with a rifle.
Such a tactic was used during the Kyōhō era (1716-1736) to kill an onikuma. The hide taken from the beast was large enough to cover more than six tatami mats.",,,,
https://yokai.com/akamanto/,Aka manto,赤マント,あかまんと,red cloak; red vest,"aoi manto, akai kami, akai hanten, akai chanchanko, akai te",school toilets,unknown,"Aka manto is an urban legend related to toilets—particularly those in elementary schools. This phenomenon is known all over Japan, with countless variations on the same theme. It usually takes place in a specific stall in a specific bathroom in the school. Usually it is an older or seldom used bathroom, often in a stall with an older style squat toilet.  Often the fourth stall is the cursed one, as the number four is associated with death.",,,"Most stories follow this general pattern: while at school late in the evening, a student suddenly finds him or herself in desperate need of a toilet. The closest restroom available is one that is normally avoided by the students; it is older and less well-kept, separated from the rest of the school, and is rumored to be haunted. But with no time to search for a different restroom, the student enters. He or she does their business, and when they have finished, they reach for the toilet paper only to find that there is none. Then they hear a strange voice: “Do you want red paper? Or blue paper?” The student answers, “Red paper,” and a moment later is stabbed and sliced up so violently that blood sprays everywhere, soaking their body and making it look as if they were wearing a bright red cloak. Some time later, another student finds him or herself in need of a toilet in a similar situation. They know the rumors that a student died in the restroom, but they have no choice and use the bathroom anyway. Sure enough, a voice asks them, “Red paper or blue paper?” Remembering the legend, this student says, “Blue paper.” Then, all of the student’s blood is sucked out of their body, leaving them dead and blue-faced on the floor.
Plenty of variations of this legend exist, each with minor differences. The true identity of Aka manto is one of these. Sometimes it is said to be a person hiding in the adjacent stall—a serial killer in many stories. Other times it is a ghost who appears as a tall man with a sickly, bluish-white face. In some places it is even blamed on a hairy yōkai called a kainade who lives in the toilet and likes to stroke people’s rear ends with its hand. In the kainade’s case, the end result is markedly less violent: a hairy arm of the chosen color rises out of the toilet to stroke the student’s behind.
In some cases, instead of draining your blood, “blue paper” gets you strangled until your face turns blue. Sometimes answering “red paper” gets your skin flayed so that it hangs off of your back like a red cape (a play on the “aka manto” name). In other versions, instead of being killed, the student’s skin color will change permantly to whatever color he or she chose. Sometimes those who survive and tell the story to others fall terribly ill and die shortly after. And sometimes the consequences are worse than death, such as being dragged into the netherworld, never to be seen again.
The questions have many variations as well, including “red vest or blue vest,” “red hand or blue hand,” or “red tongue or blue tongue.” Sometimes the colors are red or white, instead of blue. When the choices are red or white paper, red often results in a red tongue rising up out of the toilet to lick the student’s rear end, while white results in a white hand rising up to stroke the student’s rear end. Less common choices are red paper or purple paper: choosing purple allows the student to escape unharmed, while choosing red causes the student to be pulled down through the toilet into the plumbing.
As with many urban legends, there is usually no escape from your horrible fate—though that doesn’t stop people from trying. Clever students who bring extra toilet paper with them discover that it vanishes before they are able to use it, and still find themselves having to answer to Aka manto. People who choose a different color other than those offered in hopes to confuse the spirit are met with an equally horrible death (one common version has a student say “yellow paper,” and the result is that their face is pushed down into the dirty toilet water and held there until they drown). In some instances, students have been able to escape by saying “I don’t need any paper,” buying them just enough time to run out of the bathroom before anything happens.
Aka manto’s appearance has changed over time along with the Japanese lexicon. Today, manto is the Japanese word for a cloak or a cape, and so aka manto is usually depicted wearing a long red hooded cloak. However, in the 1930’s when this urban legend was born, manto referred to a shorter, sleeveless kimono jacket. As a result, different generations have different visual impressions of what Aka manto looks like.","Tracing the origin of urban legends can be difficult. Aka manto is fairly old as far as urban legends go. It is recorded as a popular schoolyard rumor as early as the 1930’s, and its popularity hasn’t faded even as newer toilet legends (such as Toire no Hanako-san) have come into existence. One explanation for Aka manto’s origin and continued popularity is in its nature. It may be a reflection of the anxiety inherent in being a student. Aka manto asks children an impossible question to which any answer results in something terrible. That feeling is not too different from having to answer a difficult problem on a test, or a teacher’s question in front of the whole classroom when you don’t know the answer.",,,

He appears as a hideous demon dressed in monks robes, crawling about on all fours. His legend is preserved at Gangō-ji, which was founded in 593 by Soga no Umako.",,,"Shortly after, the peasant and his wife had a child. Just as promised the child was as strong as a thunder god. As the boy grew, he became renowned far and wide for his superhuman strength. By the time he turned 10, he had grown so powerful and boastful that he challenged a prince to a contest of strength and won. This attracted attention of the imperial court, and the boy was apprenticed to Gangō-ji.
Shortly after he joined Gangō-ji, the temple’s young apprentices began dying strange deaths one by one. Every morning, the fresh corpse of one of the boys would be found by the temple’s bell tower. The monks decided that an evil spirit was infiltrating the temple at night and committing the murders. The peasant’s son resolved to solve the mystery. He volunteered to catch whatever was killing the boys.
That night, the boy placed covered lanterns in the four corners of the bell tower. He instructed an older monk to wait by the lanterns and uncover them once he grabbed the evil spirit. The boy waited by the bell tower. At midnight a hunched creature came crawling towards the tower. It saw the boy, however, and ran away.
A few hours later, hunger got the better of the creature and it slinked back. The boy sprang and caught it by the hair, but the monk was too scared to uncover the lanterns. Summoning his superhuman strength, the boy dragged the creature to each corner of the tower and uncovered the lights. In the lamplight, he could see that the creature was a reiki—the ghost of an oni.
The reiki pulled back so hard that it ripped off its own scalp. Once free, it scampered away into the darkness, leaving its hair in the boy’s hand. When morning came, the priests followed the bloody trail left by the creature. They found the grave of a lazy, wicked servant formerly employed by the temple. The servant’s spirit had transformed into the demon ghost that was responsible for the murders.
After that, the reiki never returned to the temple again. The monster’s scalp became one of the holy treasures of Gangō-ji. The boy became famous far and wide. He used his superhuman strength to irrigate the temple’s fields, and eventually took the name Dōjō and became a splendid priest. After he died, he was enshrined as one of the gods of Gangō-ji.",,"Long ago in Owari Province, during the time of Emperor Bidatsu, a thunder god fell out of the sky in bolt of lightning. A peasant investigated the spot where the bolt struck, and discovered the thunder god in the form of a young boy.

The thunder god promised to give the peasant and his wife a young boy as strong as a god if the peasant would help him.

Some boxes have been passed down from mother to daughter over and over for centuries.

Beautiful shells of the right size and color were collected and decorated, their insides lined with gold and painted with scenes from popular stories, such as The Tale of Genji. The two halves of the same shell would be painted with the same scene, and players of the game would try to match the two sides.

They exhibit some ghost-like traits; they and their dwellings are often invisible during the day, appearing only to unsuspecting travelers during the night. They usually hunt their prey at night as well, slipping into temples when the dead are lain there for funerary prayers.
The son of the village chief welcomed Soseki and invited him to stay in his house as a guest. “However,” he said, “my father passed away earlier today. In our village, we have a custom. When one of us dies, we all must spend the night away from the village. If we do not do this, we will be cursed. But you are tired from your journey, and seeing as you are a priest, and also not a member of this village, I see no reason why you too must leave. Please feel free to stay in my house this night while the rest of us leave the village.” Soseki gratefully accepted. The villagers all left the village, and Soseki was alone.
That night, the monk recited funerary prayers over the body of the village chief. All of a sudden, he felt a presence nearby. Soseki felt his body freeze up, and he was unable to move. Then, a dark, hazy shape crept through the house and up to the body. The creature devoured the remains of the village chief, and then slipped away as quietly as it had arrived.
The following morning, when the villagers returned, Soseki told them what he had seen during the night. The village chief’s son told him that this was just as the local legends say. Soseki was surprsied, and asked why the monk living in the hermitage did not perform the funeral prayers for the village. The village chief’s son seemed confused. “There is no hermitage nearby. What’s more, there haven’t been any monks in this region for many generations…”
Soseki traced his steps through the mountains to the old hermitage he had seen the night before. The old monk welcomed him into the hovel and told him, “I apologize for showing you such a sight last night. The monster you saw in the village chief’s house was me. Long, long ago I was a priest. I lived in that village, and I performed many funeral services for the dead. However, all I could think of was the payment for my services, and not the souls of the deceased. Because of my lack of conviction, when I died I was reborn as a jikininki. Now, I am forced to feed off the bodies of the dead. Please, save my soul and release me from my torment!”
In that instant, the elderly monk and the dilapidated old hermitage both disappeared. Soseki was sitting on the dirt, surrounded by tall grass. The only feature nearby was an ancient, moss-covered gravestone.","Jikininki are closely related to gaki—hungry ghosts of Buddhist cosmology who are constantly starving but unable to eat anything. A jikininki is born when a person performs evil deeds, corrupting his soul. Some jikiniki were corrupt priests who could not properly pass on after their deaths. Others were once humans who, for some reason or another, developed a taste for human flesh.

Families who own hinnagami quickly become rich and powerful; and people who become rich and famous very quickly are sometimes suspected of owning hinnagami.,"Hinnagami come with a catch: if a new request is not made as soon as a wish is granted, the hinnagami will demand, “What is next?” As soon as that request is fulfilled, the hinnagami demands another, and another, and another. This pattern never ends. Because their creation comes out of human greed and desire, hinnagami cling to their creators obsessively and never leave their sides. A hinnagami’s attachment is so powerful, in fact, that even death cannot separate it from its master. When a hinnagami’s creator dies, the hinnagami will follow them to hell and haunt them for all of eternity.
In the most common ritual, the person who wishes to create a hinnagami must begin collecting grave earth that has been trampled on by people during the day. Grave earth must be collected in this way every night for three years. For an even stronger hinnagami, they should take earth from seven different graveyeards in seven different villages. Once collected, the grave earth is mixed with human blood until it becomes clay-like. Then it is molded into a doll shape representing a god or a spirit that its creator worships. This doll is placed and left in a busy road until it has been trampled upon by one thousand people. Then the creator retrieves the doll, which has become a hinnagami.
An alternative method is to collect graveyard stones and carve them into one thousand small dolls, each about nine centimeters long. These dolls are boiled in a large pot until only one of them rises to the surface. The doll that rises is said to contain the combined souls of all one thousand dolls. It becomes a special type of hinnagami called a kochobbo.","Hinnagami are created through a long and complicated ritual.

https://yokai.com/kenmun/,Kenmun,水蝹,けんむん,water spirit,"kenmon, kawataro, yamawaro",the Amami islands,primarily fish and shellfish,"Kenmun are hairy water and tree spirits from the Amami islands in southern Japan. They look like a cross between a kappa and a monkey. They also closely resemble their Okinawan cousins, kijimunā. Their bodies are covered in dark red or black hair, and they have long, thin legs and arms. They are slightly larger in size than a human child. They have pointed mouths, and on top of their heads is a saucer-like depression which holds a small amount of oil or water. Their bodies smell like yams, and their drool smells terrible.","Kenmun make their homes in banyan trees and spend their days playing in the mountains or near the water in their family groups. They particularly enjoy sumo wrestling, at which they are very skilled. As the seasons change, they migrate back and forth from the mountains to the sea.",Kenmun stay away from inhabited areas and run away when large groups of people are nearby. They will occasionally aid lone woodcutters and people gathering firewood by carrying heavy loads for them. They remember those who treat them kindly or do them favors. A fisherman who saves a kenmun from being attacked by an octopus is sure to earn its eternal gratitude. Some elderly islanders who have befriended kenmun are to call friendly kenmun out from the mountains to show to their grandchildren.,"Kenmun have a number of strange abilities. They are able to change their shapes. They often disguise themselves as people, horses, or cows. They can change into plants and blend in with the surrounding vegetation, or even disappear entirely. Kenmun can also create light. Their drool glows eerily, as do their fingertips. They have the ability to create fire from the tips of their fingers. Sometimes they use this fire to light the oil in their head-dishes. When mysterious lights are seen in the mountains or on the shores of the Amami islands, it is called kenmun machi by locals.
Kenmun like to hunt at night, lighting up their fingertips to search for food in the dark. They primarily feed on fish and small shellfish. They also enjoy slugs and snails, pulling off the shells and rolling them up like rice balls. (It is possible to identify a banyan tree inhabited by a kenmun by the sheer amount of snail shells piled up among its roots.) They absolutely hate octopus and giant clams, and will have nothing to do with them.
In general, kenmun do not harm people. They do, however, love competition, and cannot resit the chance to challenge a human to a sumo match. When their head-dish is filled, they have supernatural strength and cannot be beaten. However, kenmun like to mimic people, so if a challenger stands on their head or bows very low, their head-dish will empty out and they can be beaten.
While kenmun are not evil, they do enjoy playing pranks on humans from time to time. They may shape shift into animals and try to scare humans, or offer directions to people that get them totally and helplessly lost. They also have no shame about stealing food or even utensils from humans. Kenmun are very sensitive about being insulted, particularly about their body odors. Because of this, if a person talks about bad smells or farting while in the mountains, any kenmun who overhear it will become upset.
Kenmun do occasionally do wicked things to humans. There are stories of children who wandered into the woods and had their souls stolen by kenmun. Afterwards, the children behaved like kenmun, living in banyan trees and leaping from tree to tree when the villagers tried to catch them. Adults can have their souls stolen by kenmun as well. Kenmun like to force feed them snails, or pull them into rivers. These people are often later found unconscious beneath a banyan tree. If a banyan tree in which a kenmun lives is cut, the kenmun will place a curse upon the woodcutter. The kenmun’s curse causes its victims eyes to swell up, and then go blind. Eventually the cursed person will die.
Some families hang pig foot bones or Japanese pittosporum branches from the eaves of their roofs in order to keep kenmun from coming close. To drive away a kenmun, all it takes is to threaten it with an octopus. Merely threatening to throw an octopus at them is enough to send them running. If an octopus is not available to throw at them, they will also run away from a giant clam, or anything else you throw at them as long as you pretend it’s an octopus.",,,,octopus and giant clams

They are usually depicted carrying weapons and wearing ornate armor.","Yasha are one of the members of the the Eight Legions–eight supernatural races who listened to the sermons of Shaka Nyōrai and converted to Buddhism. Along with the ten, ryū, kendatsuba, ashura, karura, kinnara, and magoraka, they serve as guardians of the Buddhist teachings.",,"Yasha serve Buddhism in a number of ways. Most importantly, the Twelve Heavenly Generals (the twelve most fearsome yasha), serve as the personal bodyguards of Yakushi Nyōrai, the buddha of medicine. They wage war on sickness and fight the enemies of Buddhism. They are also important in astrology–as there are twelve of them, they are associated with the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac, the hours of the day, the months, and the directions. Their leader, General Kubira, is also an important kami in the Shinto faith. He is believed to be the manifestation of Konpira, a god of fishing, seafaring, and farming. He is enshrined as Ōmononushi in the Kotohira shrine of Kagawa Prefecture, alongside Sutoku Tennō.
Yasha, along with another kind of demon called rasetsu, are used as soldiers in the armies of Bishamonten, one of the Four Heavenly Kings. Bishamonten is often depicted trampling a tiny, evil yasha (called a jaki or amanojaku) under his feet. His armor is also often decorated with scowling yasha faces. In this way yasha also serve as a symbol the triumph of virtue over wickedness.
When Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese interpretation of yasha was brought along with it. In Japan, yasha were often viewed as Buddhist manifestations of local evil spirits, like amanojaku and oni. Yasha took on some of the characteristics of these spirits, and sometimes even became synonymous with them.","Yasha come from Hindu mythology. They were originally benevolent nature spirits and caretakers of the trees and earth. In Buddhism, they were interpreted as evil, ghost-like spirits who preyed upon travelers, but later gave up their wicked ways upon hearing the sermons of the Buddha.

That night, a beautiful woman visited Hidesato. She introduced herself as the daughter of the dragon king of Like Biwa. The dragon king had sent her to Hidesato to ask for his help. Her family was being tormented by an ōmukade who lived on Mount Mikami. She knew that Hidesato must be a brave warrior, because he had so fearlessly trampled her body.

It was believed that in the event of a fire, the shachihoko could protect the building by summoning rain clouds or by spitting out the massive amounts of water they had previously swallowed.","The shachihoko’s origins may go even further back, to India. In Hindu mythology, there is a large sea monster named Makara who is half-fish and half-beast (sometimes depicted as an elephant, a deer, a crocodile, or another animal). Makara was a powerful protector and servant of various deities. Images of Makara were commonly used in temple architecture, particularly over archways and doorways, or as rain spouts. Japanese versions of Makara tend to resemble the shachihoko more than they resemble the original Hindu creature.
Today, the Japanese word for the orca is shachi—no doubt because of its similarity to this creature.","Shachihoko as an element of construction evolved from shibi, large, ornamental roof end tiles. Shibi originated in China during the Jin dynasty and were popularized in Japan during the Nara and Heian periods.

However, they are bigger, more vicious, and much smarter. They can speak, and sometimes they are seen wearing human clothes as well. They are thought to be the remnants of an ancient monkey worshiping cult. All that is left of this religion today are wicked monkey spirits who have degenerated into yōkai.",Sarugami behave for the most part like wild monkeys. They live in the mountains and tend to stay away from human-inhabited areas.,"When sarugami interact with humans it almost always ends in violence. Most legends follow a similar pattern: a sarugami kidnaps a young woman from a villager, and heroes are called upon to go into the wilderness and exterminate the sarugami. Like oni, giant snakes, and other monsters, sarugami are beasts meant to be slain by brave samurai.","Though the early monkey cults have vanished, sarugami worship continued throughout the middle ages in esoteric religions such as Kōshin. Monkeys came to be viewed as servants of the mountain deities, or as mountain deities themselves, acting as intermediaries between the world we live in and the heavens. The famous three wise monkey statues—mizaru, kikazaru, and iwazaru (“see no evil, hear no evil, say no evil”)—come from Kōshin and are a prime example of sarugami worship.
An apocryphal legend says that long ago the Buddha appeared at Hiyoshi Taisha. Just before this occurred, a large gathering of monkeys arrived in the area. The Buddha took the form of a monkey, and foretold the fortunes of the faithful worshipers at Hiyoshi Taisha. Thousands of years earlier, Cang Jie—the legendary inventor of Chinese writing (c. 2650 BCE)—foresaw this appearance of the Buddha. Thus, when he invented the word for god (神), he constructed it out of characters meaning indicate (示) and monkey (申) to foretell this event. In other words, “monkey indicates god.” Although entertaining, this is a false etymology, and the true origin of the word for gods has nothing to do with monkeys.
In Ōmi Provice (present-day Shiga Prefecture) there lived an elderly farmer and his young daughter. The farmer toiled in his fields to exhaustion every day, while his daughter waited to be married off. But there were no suitors. One day, the farmer mumbled to himself, “Even a monkey would be ok, if only there was someone I could marry my daughter to so they would come work in my field!” Just then a giant monkey appeared and completed all of the old man’s farm work. The following day, the sarugami returned and demanded the old man’s daughter as payment for his work. When the old man refused, the saru grew angry at him for breaking his word, and he stole the man’s daughter and ran into the mountains. Back in his den, the sarugami kept the daughter tied up in a sack. Meanwhile, the old man begged a local noble to rescue his daughter. One day, while the sarugami was away from his den, the noble snuck in and freed the girl. In her place, he put his dog in the sack. When the sarugami returned to his den later he opened the sack to check on his prisoner. The dog leaped out and killed him.","According to folklorist Yanagita Kunio, sarugami are a prime example of “fallen” gods—spirits once revered as gods, but who have since been forgotten. These beliefs never entirely vanish, though, and such spirits often remain as degenerate versions of their former selves, i.e. yōkai. Long ago, before Buddhism arrived, monkeys were worshiped as gods in parts of Japan. The southern part of Lake Biwa in modern-day Shiga Prefecture was an important center of monkey worship, based at Hiyoshi Taisha. Monkeys were seen as messengers and servants of the sun, in part because they become most active at sunrise and sunset. Because of this, monkey worship was popular among farmers, who also awoke and retired with the sun. Over the centuries, as farming technology improved, people became less reliant on subsistence farming. More and more people took up professions other than farming. As a result, monkey worship began to fade away, and the monkey gods were forgotten. Today, monkeys are viewed as pests by farmers, as they dig up crops, steal food from gardens, and sometimes even attack pets and small children.","In Mimasaka Provice (present-day Okayama Prefecture) there was a giant monkey who lived in the mountains. Every year this sarugami would demand a sacrifice of a young woman from the villages around the mountain. One year, a hunter happened to be staying at the house of the young woman who was chosen to be that year’s sacrifice. Her family was devastated at the thought of losing their daughter, and the hunter took pity on them. He volunteered to take her place as a sacrifice. The hunter and his dog were loaded into a large chest and taken up into the mountains by some priests to be delivered to the sarugami. After some time, a giant sarugami more than two meters tall emerged from the woods, along with his entourage of over one hundred monkeys. The hunter and his dog leaped from the chest and attacked. One by one, the monkeys fell, until only the sarugami remained. Just then the creature possessed one of the priests and spoke through him. The sarugami asked for forgiveness and promised never to demand another sacrifice. The hunter allowed to sarugami to run away, and the sarugami has never asked for another sacrifice since.",,

In these scrolls he is prying open a Chinese-style chest and releasing a horde of tsukumogami—presumably the objects that were stored in the chest and forgotten.,,"In his description of chirizuka kaiō, Toriyama explains that there is nothing in creation which does not have a leader; the kirin is king of the beasts, the hōō is king of the birds, and so this chirizuka kaiō must be the king of the yama uba. The phrase is actually another pun, and refers to a line from the noh play Yamanba. The line explains that worldly attachments pile up like dust, and if you let them build up into a dust heap then you may turn into a yama uba. Despite this phrasing, chirizuka kaiō has come to be interpreted as the king of tsukumogami rather than yama uba. This is most likely because he appears in Hyakki tsurezure bukuro, which is full of tsukumogami. There is no other connection between chirizuka kaiō and yama uba, as chirizuka kaiō has only ever been depicted releasing yōkai from a chest. Perhaps Toriyama used the word yama uba as an allusion to yōkai born from worldly attachment and ignorance. Yama uba are created when one’s improper attachments pile up like a dust heap. Tsukumogami are born out of forgotten household objects whose owners could not bring themselves to properly dispose of. The same kind of improper attachment is what forms both of these yōkai.","Chirizuka kaiō’s earliest appearance comes from the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573 CE). In the earliest scrolls he is depicted without name or explanation. His name first appears in the Edo period, where he is depicted in Toriyama Sekien’s tsukumogami encyclopedia Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. This book contains a number of yokai based on puns. Chirizuka kaiō’s name appears to be a pun based on essay 72 from Tsurezure gusa, a popular collection of essays from the 14th century.

Similarly, amabiko instructs people to spread its image around to protect them from the disease. “Amabie” may have been a simple typographical error, or else it may be a regional variation of the amabiko.","Little is known of the amabie’s characteristics. However, its story is very similar to other prophetic yōkai such as jinja hime and kudan, which deliver a prognostication and then disappear. These yōkai began appearing during a period when diseases like cholera were killing people all over the world. Images of protector yōkai that could be used as charms against sicknesses were in high demand. It is very possible that amabie was a sort of copycat yōkai, following the trends of the time.","The only recorded sighting of an amabie comes from Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto prefecture) in April of 1846. For some nights in a row, a bright light could be seen in the waters off shore. One night, a government official went out to see to investigate the strange light.

It is usually portrayed holding the mallet over its head, ready to strike another yōkai.",,,"It has been suggested that kanazuchibō may be a spirit of cowardice.  His posture and his hammer evoke the proverbs “to strike a stone bridge before crossing” (meaning to be excessively careful before doing anything) and “like a hammer in the water” (meaning to always be looking at the ground and watching your step; picture a hammer in a river, with its heavy head sinking below the surface, but its wooden handle floating upright). Perhaps this is a yōkai which haunts cowards, or which turns people into cowards when it haunts them.
Kanazuchibō is also known as ōari, or giant ant. In prehistoric Japan there was a culture which built large earthen burial mounds known as kofun. It has been suggested that in the Kofun people’s religion, ants were revered as divine creatures since they build earthen mounds. As the Kofun religion died out, those creatures formerly worshiped as kami grew resentful and warped into these ant-like yōkai. While it’s an amusing story, there’s no evidence to suggest the Kofun people actually worshipped ants. This explanation was almost certainly made up by modern storytellers.
Toriyama Sekien included a version of this yōkai in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. He re-imagined it as a tsukumogami born from a keyari—a hairy spear used as decoration and in parades. He named it yarikechō, or “spear hair chief.”","A mallet-weilding yōkai appears in many of the earliest picture scrolls of the night parade of one hundred demons. In its oldest depictions, kanazuchibō appears with no name or description. Names like kanazuchibō and daichiuchi were added much later, during the Edo period.

It also fits an established pattern of monsters being named in baby talk; waira, otoroshi, gagoze, and uwan are also thought to be “baby-fied” variations of scary words.",,,

It resembles a red oni, with a large head and dark, kelp-like hair. It wears the clothing typical of a workman.",,"Appossha live in the Sea of Japan off of Fukui prefecture. They appear on land once a year, on Koshōgatsu—a holiday celebrating the first full moon of the lunar new year. On this night, the appossha crawl out of the sea and wander the village streets, banging iron tea kettles and chanting, “Appossha!” The travel from house to house, demanding food and threatening children. They ask each house if there are any ill-mannered children living there that they can take back to the sea with them. Once a household’s children have been thoroughly scared, the parents give a gift of mochi to the appossha and it leaves.","The appossha is part of a family of oni-like yōkai which are found all over Japan, but especially along the Sea of Japan coast. The namahage of Akita Prefecture are the most famous example. In nearby Ishikawa and Niigata Prefectures, similar yōkai named amamehagi can be found. In Yamagata they are known as amahage. Although the minor details (such as where the yōkai come from) differ, the key parts of each story are the same: these yōkai come from the wilderness around the new year, scare young children, and leave once offered a gift from the villagers.
Appossha are an example of a type of creature called a marebito. In Japanese folk religion, marebito are divine spirits—demons, gods, or otherwise—which come from the world of the dead to visit our world at set times. Some deliver prophecies or bring gifts, others bring disaster. The strange foreign spirit is welcomed as a guest, fed, sheltered, and treated kindly and respectfully. Sometimes they are revered as gods. Their coming is often welcomed in the form of festivals and rituals. Although the marebito folk religion is no longer practiced today, aspects of it are still a visible part of Japanese culture. Yōkai like the appossha and namahage, and festivals like Obon have preserved many of the elements of this ancient folk religion.","The appossha tradition is said to come from long ago, when a sailor from a foreign land was shipwrecked and swam ashore in Fukui prefecture. He traveled from door to door begging for food. The name “appossha” is thought to be a heavily accented variation of the foreigner’s words, asking for some mochi to eat: “Appo (mochi) hoshiya (want).”",,,

It appears in houses with tall ceilings, particularly in the cold months when light cannot reach all the way to ceiling and casts weird shadows into the rafters. It’s body is covered with strips of paper which resemble a matoi—the paper flags carried by Edo period firemen.","Tenjōname is named for its primary activity: licking ceilings. The older a house gets, the more dust and grime collects in hard-to-clean places such as the ceiling. This attracts tenjōname, who lick the dirty ceilings to feed on the filth. The telltale sign that a tenjōname has been licking a ceiling is the appearance of dark stains and splotches on ceilings, walls, and support pillars.",,,"Tenjōname first appears in Toriyama Sekien’s Hyakki tsurezure bukuro, although its appearance seems to be inspired by older yōkai scrolls. Like many of the entries in that book, it appears to be a pun based on one of the essays in Yoshida Kenkō’s Tsurezure gusa. Essay number fifty five gives advice on building a house, and states that too high a ceiling would make winters feel too cold and lamplight seem to dark. Toriyama Sekien references this essay in his description of tenjōname. Although it is not specifically stated, based on its appearance and the fact that most of the yōkai in Hyakki tsurezure bukuro are tsukumogami, it is likely that tenjōname is a transformed matoi.","Since tenjōname was created in the 18th century, older folktales about it do not exist. However, since then a number of stories have been invented. One such story claims that a samurai from Tatebayashi Castle (the ruins of which are in present-day Gunma Prefecture) captured a tenjōname and used it to clean all the spiderwebs and grime from the ceilings of the castle. More recent legends claim that the stains left by tenjōname take the form of hideous human faces.

Along with Oiwa and Otsuyu, Okiku’s tale is one of the Nihon san dai kaidan—Japan’s Big Three Ghost Stories. Her story has been retold countless times in folk tales, puppet theater, kabuki, film, and manga. Though the general outline of her story remains the same, the names, locations, and surrounding details vary quite a bit from telling to telling. The most famous version of her story is called Banchō sarayashiki—”The Dish Manor at Banchō.” It takes place in Himeji, present-day Hyōgo Prefecture.",,,"Eventually, Aoyama grew impatient with Okiku and decided to trick her into becoming his lover. In the castle there was a set of ten very expensive dishes. Aoyama hid one of the them, and then called for Okiku. He told her one of his master’s fine dishes was missing, and demanded to know where it was. Okiku became frightened. Losing one of her lord’s prized dishes was a crime punishable by death. She counted the dishes, “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine…” She recounted them against and again. Each time she came up one short. Okiku was distraught.
Aoyama told Okiku that he would overlook her mistake, and tell his master that it wasn’t Okiku who lost the dish—but only if she would become his mistress. Though Okiku wanted to live, she once again refused Aoyama. This time the samurai became furious. He ordered his servants to beat Okiku with a wooden sword. Afterwards, he had her tied up and suspended over the castle well. He tortured Okiku, repeatedly dunking her into the well, only to pull her back out of the water and beat her himself. Aoyama demanded one last time that Okiku become his mistress. She refused. So Aoyama struck her violently with his sword and dropped her body down into the well.
Not long after, Okiku’s ghost was seen wandering the castle grounds. Night after night, she would rise from the well and enter her master’s house, searching for the missing dish. She would count the plates: “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine…” After counting the ninth plate, she would let out a blood curdling scream that could be heard throughout the castle. She tormented Aoyama in this way, every night, robbing him of his rest. Those who heard part of Okiku’s counting became very sick. Those unlucky enough to hear her count all the way to nine died shortly after.
Finally, the lord of the castle decided that something had to be done about Okiku’s ghost. He called a priest, and asked him to pray for her and exercise her spirit. The priest waited in the garden all night, chanting suttras. One again, Okiku’s ghost rose out of the well. She began to count the dishes: “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine…” As soon as Okiku counted the ninth dish, and before she could scream, the priest shouted out: “TEN!” Okiku’s ghost appeared relieved that someone had found the missing dish. From then on, she never haunted the castle again.",,"Long ago, there was a woman named Okiku who worked as a dishwashing servant at Himeji Castle. Okiku was very beautiful, and it was not long before she caught the eye of one of her master’s retainers, a samurai named Aoyama.

Oiwa’s story is based on real people who lived in 17th century Edo. Their story was dramatized in the 1825 kabuki play Tōkaidō yotsuya kaidan, which became very popular and cemented Oiwa’s place as Japan’s most famous ghost. Countless variations and adaptations of her tale followed.",,,"The real Oiwa died in 1636. It is rumored that her onryō still haunts the places she lived as well as those who perform her story. Mysterious disasters and deaths occurring around a number of productions (including theater, film, and television adaptations) have been blamed on the curse of Oiwa’s ghost. There have been numerous attempts to appease her angry spirit.  A small shrine and a temple dedicated to Oiwa were erected on the ruins of her family’s house in Yotsuya. After a fire destroyed the shrine in 1879, Oiwa’s shrine was moved to another part of Tōkyo. The shrine was again destroyed in the firebombings of World War 2. After the war, her new shrine as well as the original location in Yotsuya were both rebuilt. A gravestone at Myōgyōji in Sugamo, Tokyo is widely believed to be Oiwa’s actual grave. It is customary for actors and crews putting on a production of Yotsuya kaidan to visit Oiwa’s grave to pay their respects.
Some time after that, Oiwa became pregnant and bore Iemon a son. Times were hard. They had little money. Oiwa became sickly after giving birth, and Iemon grew resentful of Oiwa. Next to their home lived a rich doctor named Itō Kihei. He had a beautiful granddaughter named Oume. Oume was instantly attracted to Iemon, and wanted to marry him. The doctor loved his granddaughter and conspired to help her marry Iemon. He prescribed an ointment for Oiwa to help her recover from her sickness. In reality, it was a poison which horribly disfigured her face. Seeing Oiwa’s scarred face, Iemon’s resentment turned into hatred. Afterwards, Kihei suggested that Iemon divorce Oiwa and marry his granddaughter instead; if he were to marry Oume, all of the wealth of the Itō family could be his to inherit!. Iemon was so disgusted by Oiwa’s face, and Oume was so young and attractive, that he agreed. Iemon began pawning Oiwa’s possessions, her kimono, her clothes—even their son’s clothes—to have enough money to marry Oume. Because he needed a legitimate reason to divorce his wife, Iemon hired his friend Takuetsu to rape Oiwa so that he could accuse her of infidelity.
On a prearranged night, when Iemon was out of the house, Takuetsu entered and approached Oiwa. Upon seeing her face, he was so frightened that he abandoned his orders. Takuetsu explained Iemon’s plan to Oiwa, and then showed her a mirror. Oiwa had not known what the ointment had done to her face. When she saw her reflection, she was horrified. She tried to cover the disfigurement by brushing her hair over it, but when she touched her hair, it fell out in large, bloody clumps. Oiwa went mad. She grabbed a nearby sword and punctured her own throat. As Oiwa lay on the floor bleeding to death, she repeatedly cursed Iemon’s name until she could breathe no more.
Oiwas’ body was discovered by Iemon’s servant Kohei. When Kohei delivered the news to Iemon, instead of become upset, Iemon was overjoyed. Kohei became suspicious of Iemon, but before he could do anything, Iemon murdered Kohei. He nailed Kohei’s and Oiwa’s bodies to a door, and disposed of them in a river. Afterwards, he made up a lie that Kohei and Oiwa had been sleeping together. He was finally free to marry Oume.
Oiwa’s curse did not wait long to take effect. On his wedding night to Oume, Iyemon had trouble sleeping. He rolled over in bed and saw, right next to his face, the horrible, disfigured face of Oiwa’s ghost! He grabbed his sword and slashed out at the ghost. Just then, the illusion ended, and Iemon saw that it was not Oiwa he had cut, but Oume. His new bride lay dead on the floor. Terrified, Iemon ran next door to seek his new father in law’s help. However, when he got to the Itō house, he was confronted by the ghost of the murdered Kohei. Once again Iemon slashed with his sword, but no sooner had he done so than the illusion ended and he saw Itō Kihei’s slain body lying on the floor.
Afterwards, Iemon fled into the night, but Oiwa’s onryō pursued him. Everywhere he went, Oiwa’s ghost was there. Her ruined face haunted his dreams. Her terrible voice cried out to him for vengeance. She even appeared to him in the paper lanterns that lit his way. Eventually, Iemon ran into the mountains, where he hid in an isolated cabin. But Oiwa followed him there too. Haunted by Oiwa’s ghost, no longer able to tell nightmare from reality, Iemon descended into madness.",,"Oiwa was married to samurai named Iemon. It was not a happy marriage, for Iemon was a wasteful man and a thief. One day, Oiwa decided to leave her husband and return to her family home. Iemon followed after her, but was stopped by Oiwa’s father, Yotsuya Samon. Samon knew of Iemon’s misdeeds—that he had stolen money from his employer—and he demanded that Iemon divorce Oiwa. Iemon drew his sword and murdered Samon. Iemon returned to Oiwa and lied that a stranger had killed her father on the road.

Although her story was originally a Chinese folk tale, it was adapted into Japanese in the 17th century. It was later adapted for rakugo and kabuki, with various changes, extra characters, and more details added to flesh out the story. Her story takes place during Obon, when the dead are believed to return to the land of the living. Otsuyu’s story is rare among Japanese ghost stories, as her tale is one of love rather than of vengeance.",,,"To Ogiwara’s delight, Otsuyu and her servant returned the following evening, carrying the same peony lantern. Ogiwara fell deeply in love with Otsuyu. He quickly lost interest in seeing anybody but her. Ogiwara no longer left his house, and stopped taking care of himself. Night after night, Otsuyu visited Ogiwara’s house. Each night they made love, and each night she left before dawn.
Twenty days passed. Ogiwara’s neighbors began to grow concerned for him. Next door to Ogiwara lived a wise old man. One night, the old man heard laughing and singing coming from next door. He peeked through a hole in Ogiwara’s wall. However, instead of a beautiful woman, he saw Ogiwara entwined in the boney arms of a skeleton. When Ogiwara spoke, the skeleton nodded its head and moved its arms and legs. When the skeleton’s jaw opened, a haunting voice came from where its mouth should have been. The old man was horrified.
As soon as day came, the old man called for Ogiwara. He warned Ogiwara that Otsuyu was really a ghost, and told him to go to a temple at once. Ogiwara heeded the old man’s advice. At the temple, Ogiwara discovered Otsuyu’s grave, with her old and tattered peony lantern draped across it. The priest warned Ogiwara that he must resist Otsuyu, and gave him a magical charm to place on his house, which would keep him safe from the ghost. Ogiwara rushed home and placed the charm on his door. The charm worked perfectly, and Otsuyu no longer came to visit Ogiwara.
Although he was safe, Ogiwara became despondent. He missed Otsuyu dearly. One night, days after her last visit, Ogiwara became drunk. He carelessly wandered to the temple where he discovered Otsuyu’s grave. At the temple gate, Otsuyu appeared to him, and led him to her home: her coffin. Later, when Ogiwara had been missing for some time, the priest opened up Otsuyu’s grave. Inside was the dead body of Ogiwara, wrapped up in the boney arms of a human skeleton.",,"Long ago lived a man named Ogiwara Shinnojō, who was recently widowed.

It is based on true events which happened in the 17th century in what is now Ibaraki Prefecture, although the story has changed quite a bit from the original incident. Her tale is one of the most famous Edo period ghost stories, and she is often held up with Oiwa and Okiku as a prime example of the grudge-bearing Japanese woman ghost. Her story was later adapted into rakugo and kabuki theater, as well as numerous films.",,,"The following year, Yoemon and Osugi had a baby girl. They named her Rui. Rui looked so much like her half-brother Suke did that the villagers all believed she was haunted by his spirit. Instead of Rui, they referred to her as Kasane—an alternate reading of her name which implied that the ugly Suke had been born once again in her.
Both of Kasane’s parents died while she was young, and so she lived alone. She became very sick, when a wandering stranger named Yagorō came to her house and nursed her back to health. Out of gratitude, Kasane offered to marry Yagorō and make him the inheritor of her father’s property. Although Yagorō found Kasane repulsive, he wanted her land and inheritance, and so he agreed to marry her.
Not long after they were married, Yagorō had had enough of Kasane’s ugliness. He took her out to their fields to collect beans. On the way home made Kasane carry all of the beans herself, so that she could barely walk. Just as they were crossing the pool, Yagorō pushed the overburdened Kasane into the water. Yagorō jumped in after her. He stepped on her chest, pinning her to the riverbed. He crushed and squeezed the air out of her lungs. He shoved rocks and river sand into her mouth. He stabbed her eyes with his thumbs. Then he wrung her neck until she could struggle no longer. Several townspeople witnessed Yagorō murder Kasane, but nobody moved to help her. After all, she was so ugly—there seemed to be an unspoken agreement to just leave it be.
Yagorō continued on as if nothing was different, living in Kasane’s home and maintaining her family’s lands. He remarried very quickly, and for a while was happy. However, Yagorō’s new wife died suddenly, not long after they were married. Yagorō remarried again, and again his wife died suddenly. This happened over and over again. When Yagorō had remarried six times, his wife managed to survive long enough to bear him a daughter. They named their daughter Kiku, and for a while they were happy.
When Kiku was thirteen, Yagorō’s sixth wife died. Yagorō married Kiku to a man named Kingorō and named him the successor to the Yoemon family. All of a sudden Kiku became extremely sick and collapsed to the floor. Foaming and frothing at the mouth, tears streaming from her eyes, Kiku cried that she couldn’t bear the pain. She begged for someone to help her. Suddenly, a different voice came forth from her body:
“I am not Kiku! I am your wife! The wife you murdered! You overburdened me, you threw me into the pool, you crushed me and made me drown! Don’t tell me you don’t remember me! I cursed you and all six of your wives! I am the one who killed them! I am Kasane!”
Kingorō fled the village, never to return. Kiku’s body stood up and lunged at Yagorō, but he managed to escape to the village temple. Yagorō told everyone that he had no idea what Kiku was saying; that he would never murder his own wife. The villagers, wanting to save poor Kiku, dragged Yagorō out from the temple to confront Kasane. Even as Kasane’s spirit threatened and cursed Yagorō, he defiantly proclaimed his innocence. Kasane’s spirit began naming and cursing the villagers who witnessed her murder and yet did nothing. Finally Yagorō and the others confessed their crime. Rui was such an unattractive and unpleasant person that the whole village had neglected her. Though Yagorō had performed the deed, the whole village was guilty of her murder. The villagers who didn’t witness the murder, but never bothered to ask about Rui were partially responsible too. It was their fault that Rui’s rage had created this ghost, and it was their fault that poor Kiku was suffering.
Kasane continued: “All of your ancestors are here with me in Hell!” She then proceeded to name each of their ancestors, and list their crimes. Then Kasane listed all of the crimes of the living villagers. The entire village’s pride was shattered as their sins were made public. Kasane demanded that the villagers hold a lavish memorial service and erect a beautiful stone buddha in her honor to end her suffering. However, the villagers balked at the cost to cover such a funeral. Kasane told them, “My father owned many farms around here. Sell them, and use the money to perform the services!” The villagers confessed to Kasane that her family’s lands had already been sold and distributed. Kasane’s wrath exploded. Kiku’s body twisted and floated high up into the air, and the poor girl lost consciousness.
Word of Kiku’s possession and Kasane’s curse spread far and wide. It caught the ear of a traveling priest, Saint Yūten. Yūten visited the Yoemon household to offer his prayers and try to save Kiku. He chanted the sutras and prayed and prayed with all his effort, but it had no effect. Kasane’s grudge was too powerful. Kasane’s voice taunted Yūten from Kiku’s mouth. Yūten then tried to have Kiku recite the prayers, but Kasane’s spirit interrupted and Kiku was unable to speak. Finally, Yūten grabbed Kiku’s hair with all his strength, forcing her face down onto the floor. He make Kiku bow, and demanded that she pray. Kiku was finally able to recite the sutra, and suddenly the spirit of Kasane left from her body. She was saved.
As Saint Yūten was preparing to leave Hanyū, Yagorō suddenly came to him with dire news: Kiku’s possession had returned. Yūten once again traveled to the Yoemon household, this time determined to subdue the curse no matter what the cost. When he encountered Kiku, he grabbed her hair and with all of his strength, forced her down onto the floor. As he held her down, demanding she pray, Kiku’s voice could be heard faintly mumbling. Yūten bent down close to her mouth and and listened. Then he turned to Yagorō: “Does the name Suke mean anything to you?”
Yagorō had never heard of Suke, nor had anybody else present. Saint Yūten asked the villagers, and finally an elderly man came forward. “Some sixty years ago there was a rumor that the first Yoemon’s wife had a son who was murdered and thrown into the pool. I think his name was Suke.”
“Are you Suke?” Saint Yūten asked Kiku. Kiku’s voice replied, “Yes. When you saved Rui you left me behind, and now I possess her.” Yūten wasted no item. He immediately gave Suke a kaimyō—a posthumous Buddhist name—and wrote it down on the family altar. Suke’s spirit left Kiku’s body and entered the altar. Everyone present dropped to the floor and prayed. Kiku eventually remarried, and lived a happy and prosperous life. The spirits of Kasane and Suke were never heard from again.",,"Long ago in the village of Hanyū in Shimosa Provence lived a farmer named Yoemon and his wife Osugi.

It describes a person who has to do something that they really don’t want to do. As they search for some way out of it, they turn around and look behind them as if the hairs in the back of their head were being metaphorically pulled.

The kettle was given the name “bunbuku chagama”—chagama being the word for tea kettle, and bunbuku meaning “to spread luck.” The name was a pun as well: the sound of boiling water is bukubuku, which sounds very much like bunbuku. Thanks to Shukaku’s marvelous tea kettle, the gathering was a great success. The bunbuku chagama continued to be used by the temple for many years. Shukaku, as well, continued to work at Morinji for many years after that.
According to Morinji’s records, On February 28, 1587, a monk walked in on Shukaku while he was taking a nap. The monk noticed that Shukaku had a tanuki’s tail! Thus, Shukaku’s great secret was uncovered: he was not a human priest, but a tanuki in disguise. He had been living among humans for thousands of years. Long ago he had traveled through India and China. Eventually he met Dairin Shōtsū, who befriended him and brought him to Morinji, where he used his magic to serve the temple as best as he could. After his secret was uncovered, Shukaku decided it was time to leave Morinji. To apologize for the great shock he had caused Morinji, he gave them a parting gift: he used his magic to present the story of the Battle of Yashima, one of the final clashes of the Genpei War. To show their gratitude for all that he had done, the priests built a shrine to Shukaku, where he is still worshipped as a local deity. And the bunbuku chagama, which Shukaku left behind, is on display in his shrine at Morinji.","Shukaku’s story has been told by Morinji for centuries, but different versions and variations have sprung up over the years. Its popularity spread during the Edo period thanks to a booming publishing industry, and it became well known across Japan. Although Shukaku is associated with Morinji, the structure of his story—a magical animal presenting a wonderful gift to humankind—is a recurring motif throughout Japanese folklore.","Morinji was founded in 1426 by a priest named Dairin Shōtsū. While he was traveling through various countries on pilgrimage, he befriended a priest named Shukaku, and they traveled together. After Morinji was built, Shukaku stayed on to act as a head priest there for many years.",,

It’s entire body is black, and it wears black robes. Its face has somewhat bestial features. It has a long tongue, and it reeks of rotting fish. Its hands and feet are said to be indiscernible. It can change its height rapidly, becoming a towering monster in an instant. It is extremely fast, and can run as fast as if it were flying.",,"Kuro bōzu haunt areas inhabited by humans. They come out at night, sneaking into houses after everyone is asleep. They creep up to their victims—primarily women—and suck the breath out of their mouths. They also slide their putrid tongues into the mouths, ears, and all over the faces of their victims. Those visited repeatedly by kuro bōzu become very ill.","Again and again for several nights, the kuro bōzu returned to assault the carpenter’s wife. Finally, she could not put up with it anymore. She left her husband and went to stay with some relatives. According to the carpenter, after his wife left, the black monk stopped coming.
","Kuro bōzu didn’t appear in folklore until the Meiji period, so they are relatively new by yōkai standards. Because of the wide variations in reports, it is hard to come up with a clear picture of this yokai’s identity. Some experts believe they are a kind of nopperabō, due to their vague and indiscernible features. Some compare them to yamachichi, who also sneak into houses to steal the breath of sleeping humans. Its size-changing abilities and monk-like appearance suggest that it may be a variety of taka nyūdō. Still others say that it is one of the forms taken by magical kawauso.","The most well known kuro bōzu report comes from the early Meiji period, from a newspaper article in the Hōchi Shinbun. The encounter took place at a certain carpenter’s house in Kanda, Tokyo. At midnight, a black, shadowy figure shaped like a monk suddenly appeared in the house. The creature entered the bedroom where husband and wife were sleeping. It climbed over the carpenter’s sleeping wife and stuck its tongue in her ears and mouth. Then it licked her all over.

Although it doesn’t directly attack people, its presence is disturbing enough. It blows out the lights suddenly, and it licks up the precious lamp oil, making it difficult to continue working.","The word “oven bug” in its name is probably a reference to cockroaches. The hima kanji in this yokai’s name can also be read kama—and likely refers to the kamado, a traditional Japanese oven. Cockroaches have quite a few nicknames in Japanese; among them himushi (“fire bug”) and hitorimushi (“lamp bug”), both of which sound similar to himamushi. Cockroaches and other pests would have fed on the fish oil in Edo period oil lamps; just like this yōkai. Cockroaches live in dark, warm spaces, such as underneath a kamado; just like this yōkai. And they crawl out of the floorboards to scare those working late at night; just like this yōkai.
Himamushi nyūdō’s name contains a number of puns. According to Toriyama Sekien, it was originally called himamushiyo nyūdō (“monks who waste time at night”). Over the years, the pronunciation gradually morphed, and it became associated with hemamusho nyūdō—a popular Edo period word doodle in which a monk is drawn using the characters in its name: ヘマムショ入道. The connection with this cartoon character would probably have amused readers during Sekien’s time.","According to Toriyama Sekien’s description of this yōkai in Konjaku hyakki shūi, himamushi nyūdō is born from those who were lazy in life, carelessly wasting time from birth to death.",,,

At night they leap from tree to tree, or cliff face to cliff face, with soaring jumps. They can moves as quickly as the wind, and resemble flying birds when they leap.

If you try to roast them with fire, their bodies will not burn. They have the amazing ability to revive from death merely if wind blows into their open mouths. However, they cannot revive if their skull has been broken, or if their nose is stuffed with leaves of Japanese rush (Acorus gramineus), a wetland shrub.","Fūri’s diet consists of spiders and the fragrant wood from incense trees, however they have also been observed hunting. They use a special kind of grass (the species is unknown) and climb to the top of a tree. They hold the grass out in their hands to try to attract a bird. When a bird comes for the grass, the fūri is able to catch and eat the bird.","Fūri appear in various Chinese atlases of herbology and medicine. These were referenced by Japanese authors during the Edo period, causing fūri to be incorporated into Japanese folklore. The original description of the fūri is most likely based on the colugo—a gliding mammal native to Southeast Asia.

They generally limit themselves to merely scaring humans by suddenly appearing next to them. For example, in one story a bashō no sei takes the form of a young woman, appears next to a meditating monk and asks him, “Can even inanimate plants attain buddhahood?”","They are not completely without danger, however—some local legends tell of bashō no sei assaulting and even impregnating humans. Women were warned not to walk near banana trees past 6 pm. If they did, they would run into a yōkai among the broad leaves—sometimes a monster, other times a handsome young man. Shortly after, the woman would become pregnant. When the baby was born 9 months later, it would have tusks or fangs like a demon. What’s more, the following year and again every year after that, the woman would give birth to another demon. Whenever a demon child was born, it would have to be killed by feeding it a poisonous drink made of powdered kumazasa (a type of bamboo grass); this is supposedly the reason why kumazasa is commonly found growing near houses in Okinawa.","Stories about banana tree spirits are numerous across Japanese, Chinese, and Ryūkyūan folklore. The Edo period herbalist Satō Chūryō recorded his observations about these spirits in an essay. According to him, Ryūkyū’s banana orchards were so large that they contained rows of trees many miles long. If you walked past them at night, you were guaranteed to experience something strange. He observed that the spirits that come out of the banana trees did not cause any direct harm to people other than spooking them, but nevertheless could be avoided if you carried a sword. Chūryō’s theory was that banana trees weren’t necessarily unique in having spirits, but that because their leaves are so large and they were planted in such large numbers, it is particularly easy for humans to see these trees’ spirits. He believed that was the reason for the large number of superstitions about banana trees compared with other plants.","A story from Nagano tells of a priest who was sitting outside and reciting suttras when a beautiful young woman appeared and attempted to seduce him.

https://yokai.com/housoushi/,Hōsōshi,方相氏,ほうそうし,minister of the four directions; one who sees in all directions,,,,"In ancient times, a hōsōshi was an official government minister and a priest in the imperial court. He wears special robes (the particular outfit varies depending on which shrine the ritual is being performed at), and carries a spear in his right hand and a shield in his left hand. The name also refers to a demon god which this priest would dress up as during yearly purification rituals. This god appears as a four-eyed oni who can see in all directions, and punishes all evil that it sees.","During the early Heian Period, the hōsōshi’s duties included leading coffins during state funeral processions, officiating at burial ceremonies, and driving corpse-stealing yōkai away from burial mounds. By donning the mask and costume, the hōsōshi (priest) became the hōsōshi (god) and was able to scare away evil spirits. The hōsōshi’s most famous duty was a purification ceremony called tsuina.",,"Tsuina was performed annually on Ōmisoka—the last day of the year—at shrines and government buildings (such as the imperial palace). In this ritual, the hōsōshi and his servant would run around the shrine courtyard (covering “the four directions”), chanting and warding the area against oni and other evil spirits. Meanwhile, a number of attending officials would shoot arrows around the hōsōshi from the shrine or palace buildings, symbolically defending the area against evil spirits. Other observers would play small hand drums with ritualistic cleansing significance.
The concept originated in ancient Chinese folk religion, where it is called fangxiang. The fangxiangshi wore a four eyed mask and a bear skin, and acted as a sort of exorcist. Chinese folk religion eventually became mixed with Buddhism and Taoism, and made its way to Japan. The Japanese hōsōshi’s rituals and costume were derived from this folk belief.
Over time, the Japanese version evolved further away from its Chinese roots. The hōsōshi came to be seen not as a god which keeps oni away, but as an oni itself. Rather than exorcising evil spirits, the hōsōshi became an evil spirit, and it was the imperial officials who chased away and exorcised the hōsōshi (thus symbolically chasing all evil spirits away). This may have been due to changing perceptions during the Heian period about the concept of ritual purity. The hōsōshi, who was associated with funerals and dead bodies, came to be viewed as unclean. It would be inappropriate for such a creature to be on the same “side” as the imperial household, so it became the target of the ritual instead of the officiator.
While the governmental position of hōsōshi no longer exists today, some shrines still perform annual tsuina rituals involving the hōsōshi. The celebration of Setsubun, in which beans are thrown at people wearing oni masks, is also derived from this ancient ritual.
","Hōsō was a concept related to divination, the four directions, and the magical barriers between the human world and the spirit world. It dealt with creating and maintaining these boundaries and barriers. It including things like planting trees or placing stones in the four corners of an area, or utilizing existing features like rivers and roads, which serve as natural boundaries. By maintaining these natural boundaries, the spiritual boundaries between the worlds could also be maintained, with the ultimate goal of keeping the imperial family and other government officials safe from supernatural harm.",,,

Contemporary yokai scholars have also pointed out that this yōkai’s name sounds similar to the name Enma, the lord of hell and judge of the dead. As hell is a place of fire and smoke, it has been suggested that instead of the spirit of smoke itself, enenra may actually be the spirits of the dead rising up along with the smoke.

Sometimes raijū were said to look like little dogs, but with four rear legs and two tails. Sometimes they were said to look like insects or crustaceans. Others looked like miniature dragons. Even more exotic raijū were said to be chimerical monsters composed of many different animals.","Raijū live in the sky—a world which was totally off limits to humans before the 20th century. Because of this, almost nothing can be said about their true nature or behavior. They ride bolts of lightning to earth when thunder claps, and create mayhem wherever they land. For seemingly no reason at all they attack buildings, starting fires and causing mass destruction.","Long ago, raijū were seen as divine beasts, akin to the thunder gods (raijin). Nothing was known about them except that they were fast, merciless, and deadly. Whenever lightning struck, people believed that a raijū had been sent by the gods to punish them for some reason or another.","Small raijū like burrow into humans’ belly buttons to hide from angry thunder gods. This is the origin of a Japanese superstition which says to cover your belly button when you hear thunder.
During the Edo period, “real” raijū were popular sideshow attractions, along with kappa and mermaids. Mummified and taxidermined remains of cats, monkeys, and dogs were presented as raijū and toured around the country in traveling shows. Viewers could pay a few coins to get a safe, up-close look at a dead raijū in a glass case.
During the Meiji period, society was rapidly transformed due to the influx of foreign science and technology. Yōkai like raijū were one of the first victims of this modernization. People were actively discouraged from holding on to superstitions because they were perceived as an embarrassment to the country. New understandings about electricity and lightning, and the invention of the airplane explained away the raijū’s most defining features—its life in the unreachable sky, and the god-like power of lightning. Once those mysteries were gone, the raijū had no more power over peoples’ imaginations, and so it was quickly forgotten.","Long ago the raijū was one of the most well known and most feared supernatural creatures in Japanese folklore. Yet today it is relatively minor, and practically unknown to the average person. This drastic reversal is due to advances in science during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the Edo period and earlier, lightning and other natural disasters were believed to be the work of the gods. Only gods had the power to shake the earth and send fire from the sky. Lightning strikes so quickly and so randomly that it is impossible to observe. But it has very observable effects: the terrible booms that shake the ground, the odd burn patterns on the things it strikes, and the fires that it ignites. In old Japan when buildings were all made of wood and closely packed together, a single lightning strike could cause a lot of destruction. The damage caused by lightning was indiscriminate—it destroyed everything from peasant hovels to imperial palaces. Lightning was rightly feared by all.","Because they were so scary, raijū are usually presented in stories as beasts to be slain, like oni. The most famous example is probably the nue, which attacked Kyōto and was slain by Minamoto no Yorimasa in 1153. Another legend involves the samurai Tachibana Dōsetsu. One night he was taking shelter from a storm under a tree when lightning struck. He drew his sword just in time to strike the bolt. When the smoke had cleared, there was a dead raijū on the ground next to him. Afterwards, he named his sword Raikiri, or “lightning cutter.”",,

He was born with a full set of teeth, and an oni’s strength. By the time he was 7 or 8 years old, he could slay a deer or a boar by throwing a single rock at it.

He fled into the mountains and lived in a cave, turning to robbing people to survive. He studied magic and honed his powers in his secret hideout.
Many years later, Raikō was visiting his younger brother Yorinobu. Yorinobu had captured the oni bandit Kidōmaru and locked him in his bathroom. Raikō scolded his brother for being so careless and not properly subduing the oni with ropes and chains. Raikō showed Yorinobu how to tie up an oni, and made sure Kidōmaru couldn’t escape. Then Raikō spent the night just to make sure nothing bad would happen.
That night, Kidōmaru easily broke the bonds that were holding him. He wanted revenge, so he snuck up to Raikō’s room and spied on him. Raikō noticed the oni spying on him and decided to lay a trap. In a loud voice he told his attendants that the following morning they would ride to Mount Kurama to make a pilgrimage. Hearing this, Kidōmaru ran ahead to Kurama to plan an ambush for Raikō. On the road outside of Ichiharano, Kidōmaru slaughtered a cow and climbed inside of its body to hide and wait.
When Raikō and his companions arrived at Ichiharano, they easily saw through Kidōmaru’s disguise. Raikō’s best archer, Watanabe no Tsuna, shot an arrow through the cow’s body, injuring the oni.

While her husband lived, she was a dutiful wife, helping run the temple, tending to the needs of the parishioners, cooking, cleaning, washing, and taking care of the temple grounds. However, after her husband’s death, she retreated into the temple’s living quarters and became a shut in. When her food stores ran out, she began to steal the offerings left behind by people visiting the temple. Because of this grave sin, she transformed into a yokai, unable to pass on to the next life. From then on, she developed a taste for human flesh. She survived by carving up meat from the corpses of the recently dead. When there were no fresh corpses available, she would unearth previously buried corpses and peel off chunks of their rotting skin off to gnaw on.","Kokuri babā do not usually interact with people, preferring to stay hidden away in the back rooms of their temples. However, when traveling monks pay a visit to their temple, they do not pass up the chance for some fresh meat. People who encounter a kokuri babā usually realize too late that they are in danger.","Kokuri is reminiscent of a popular folk phrase “Mukuri kokuri,” which is used as a metaphor for something scary. Indeed, Sekien points out in his description that kokuri babā is even more fearsome than Datsueba, the skin-flaying hag of the underworld. Parents would scold misbehaving children with, “Mukuri kokuri, a demon will come (if you don’t stop misbehaving)!”
Mukuri kokuri has a long history, originating in the the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. The Mongols under Kublai Khan had conquered China and Korea, and they had set their sights on Japan. The invaders were viewed by most people as the living embodiment of demons. Japan’s victory against the Mongols—thanks in no small part to two typhoons (believed to be kamikaze, or “divine winds” sent from the gods) which eradicated the two major Mongol invasion fleets—ended Mongol expansion and is had a profound impact on the identity of Japan as a nation. The memory of the invasions remained strong for generations, and became a part of folklore. The fear of invading Mongols was the basis for the phrase “Mōko Kōkuri no oni ga kuru” (“The Mongolian-Korean demons are coming!”), which over the centuries was corrupted down to just mukuri kokuri.","Kokuri babā was invented by Toriyama Sekien for his book Konjaku hyakki shūi.

Their most defining feature is their wrinkly old face caked with thick, sloppy, white face powder.",,"Oshiroi babā don’t interact with humans too often. For the most part, their looks alone are awful enough that anyone who sees them quickly runs away. They occasionally accost people, demanding makeup or trying to buy sake. In this way they are somewhat similar to other old hag yōkai who wander the streets at night, such as amazake babā. However, nearly every account of oshiroi babā describes them as hideous and scary, but not dangerous.",,"According to some local legends, oshiroi babā are a variation of yuki onna. They descend from mountains into villages on snowy nights.

It resembles a black dog with no tail and a human-like face.,"Being a tree spirit, the hōkō is said to be similar to a kodama or a yamabiko, although Toriyama Sekien goes out of his way to specifically mention that despite the similar appearance it is a separate yōkai from the yamabiko.","Most hōkō encounters are accidental. They usually involve an old woodcutter chopping into a camphor tree with an axe, and blood comes out from the tree—because a hōkō was living inside. Nevertheless there are a number of records of hōkō appearing in Japanese and Chinese chronicles. Hōkō are recorded as being edible; the ancient Chinese records that mention them include accounts of them being stewed and eaten. Apparently they taste sweet and sour, and similar to dog meat.",,"Hōkō is the Japanese pronunciation of this spirit’s Chinese name: penghou. Because of gradual changes in the writing systems of China and Japan, the characters used to write hōkō do not translate perfectly in Japanese. Legends generally refer to the hōkō being found inside of camphor trees. However, the first characters in its name can refer to a different kind of evergreen in Japanese: the sakaki (Cleyera japonica), which is an important sacred tree in Shinto. The second character in its name was used as a title for feudal lords. It’s not really clear that these were the intended meanings in the original Chinese though. According to legend, its name was recorded in the yōkai encyclopedia Hakutaku zu—the last surviving copy of which was lost thousands of years ago—so its true meaning is difficult to decipher.",,,

She is described as carrying a blue snake in her right hand and a red snake in her left hand.,"Very little is recorded about jakotsu babā’s history or life, so her behavior is the subject of speculation by storytellers. Generally, she supposedly lives near a place called “the snake mound.” She scares those who stay too close to her home by attacking them with her snakes.",,"According to Sekien, long ago there was an important man in Bukan named Jagoemon who lived in a place known as “the snake mound.” His wife was known as Jagobā (i.e. “Jago’s wife”). Over time, her name was corrupted into jakotsu babā. Jagoemon is not a famous historical or mythical figure, so Sekien’s reference may have just been invented for fun. Prior to Konjaku hyakki shūi, the name jakotsu babā appears in various pulp fiction and kabuki plays of the 1760’s and 1770’s—although it was just used as a vulgar slang word for an old woman, rather than a yōkai or a shaman. Some scholars believe that Sekien may just have taken a popular buzzword of his time, transformed it into a yōkai and attached a simple backstory to it.","It’s not quite clear where this yōkai originally comes from. She was recorded in 1780 by Toriyama Sekien in his book Konjaku hyakki shūi. Because she carries two snakes, Sekien speculated that Jakotsu babā originally came from the mythical country of Bukan (also called Fukan; known as Wuxian in Chinese). Bukan is recorded in the Shan hai jing, which Toriyama Sekien uses as his source for this record. It was supposedly located far to the west, past China on the Asian continent. The race of people who lived in Bukan were shamans, and they used snakes prominently in their divinations.",,,

His body is said to be 1000 ri long (an ancient unit of distance which varies quite a bit from age to age and place to place)—an immeasurable distance, meaning that he is impossibly large. He lives at the foot of Mount Shō, near the northern sea. His eyes glow like beams from a lighthouse, and his breath is so strong that it changes the seasons.","When Shokuin opens his eyes, day falls upon the earth. When he closes them, it becomes night. When he inhales it becomes summer. When he exhales it becomes winter. Shokuin does not need to eat, drink or breathe to survive, but when he does decide to breathe it causes huge gusts of wind.",,"Due to his size and the effects that his blinking and breathing has on the day/night and seasonal cycles, Shokuin may have been an ancient Chinese solar or fire deity, or even a personification of the sun. It has also been suggested that Shokuin may have been the aurora borealis. An ancient Chinese name for the northern lights was “red spirit,” and the location of Shokuin far to the north further supports this theory. To the ancient Chinese, the aurora may have looked like a giant red dragon thousands of kilometers long writhing across the northern sky.","Shokuin originally comes from China. Shokuin is the Japanese pronunciation of the characters that make up his name; in China he is known as Zhuyin or Zhulong. Many yōkai were lifted straight from Chinese by Japanese authors—some of them more or less word for word, others undergoing quite a bit of a transformation and reinterpretation, depending on how much liberty the authors decided to take. Toriyama Sekien’s description of Shokuin doesn’t undergo too much of a change from his source: the Sengaikyō (Chinese: Shanhaijing), an encyclopedia of fantastical Chinese mythological creatures. However, Shokuin appears in a number of other Chinese books, many of which contain contradictory statements about precisely where he lives and other details about him. It isn’t clear where exactly his home of Mount Shō is located, but Toriyama Sekien describes it as being near the Arctic Ocean.",,,
https://yokai.com/hangonkou/,Hangonkō,反魂香,はんごんこう,spirit calling incense,,,,Hangonkō is a legendary incense from ancient China which has the power to bring forth the spirits of the dead before those who burn it. Those who burn the incense will see the spirits of the dead within the smoke.,,,"Hangonkō was a popular subject in Japanese literature as well. It appears in a number of Edo period works, from ghost story books to theater, kabuki, rakugo, and bunraku. The Japanese versions star different characters connected to famous Japanese figures; for example in one story a man is overcome with grief at the death of his beloved prostitute, and a hōkan—a male geisha—recommends he try summon her using a secret incense handed down by the onmyōji Abe no Seimei.
All of the variations of the story share the same moral: after the person uses the incense to meet their lover’s spirit, it only leaves them sadder and more grieved than they were before. Hangonkō doesn’t alleviate their loneliness, it makes it worse. This story is an allegory. Smoke can be a symbol of delusion, such as attachment to the material world, or the inability to let go of a loved one after death. In Buddhism, this delusion is the ultimate cause of all suffering. The smoke of this incense prevents people from properly letting go of their loved ones and moving on. They’re stuck in the past, in a delusion, and will be forever miserable unless they learn to let go.","Hangonkō is made from the hangonjū, a magical tree with leaves and flowers that resemble those of a maple or Japanese oak. Its smell can be picked up from over 100 ri away. To make hangonkō, you steam the hangonjū’s roots until the sap comes out. Then you knead the sap to make the incense. Even a small piece of this resin is strong enough to recall the spirits of those who died from sickness or disease. There is a catch, however. Hangonkō only returns the spirit for a short time, and they only exist within the smoke of the burning incense.","The incense was famously used by Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty in China. After his beloved concubine Li Furen passed away, the emperor fell into deep depression. A Taoist sorcerer, in an attempt to ease the emperor’s grief, provided him with a bit of hangonkō so that he might see Lady Li one more time.",,

He never returned, and his family in Japan, including his young son, Hitsu no Saishō, were left not knowing even knowing whether he was alive or dead.
Many years later, when Hitsu no Saishō was an adult, he traveled to China to search for news of his missing father’s whereabouts. He traveled far and wide, and in a particular location he came across something he had never seen before: a a candlestick fashioned out of a living human being! The man had been installed like a piece of furniture onto a fancy platform, and a large candle had been affixed to his head. Every inch of his body was covered in strange tattoos. And by some combination of strange drugs and sorcery, the man’s throat had been blocked up and ability to speak had been removed.
As Hitsu no Saishō looked in amazement at the strange creation, the tōdaiki began to shed tears. Unable to speak, the man bit hard into his finger tip until it began to bleed. Then, using his finger, he wrote out a poem in his blood:
Long ago I came to China from Japan. I have the same family name as you.
The bond between father and son transcends even the seas and mountains that have separated us.
For years I have cried in this horrible place. Every day I think of my parents.
I have been transformed into this candlestick in this faraway land. I just want to go home.
Upon reading this, Hitsu no Saishō realized in horror that the tōdaiki was his own father whom he had come to China looking for!","Stories about people visiting strange lands and being transformed, or disappearing into another world and never returning are not uncommon in Japanese folklore. Fanciful stories like these might have originated in true but unsolved disappearances of loved ones.","The most famous tōdaiki story involves a real historical figure. Hitsu no Saishō was the nickname of Fujiwara no Arikuni, a Heian period noble who lived from 943-1011 CE.",,

He lived in the Suzuka Mountains on the border of Ise and Ōmi Provinces during the reign of Emperor Kanmu (781 to 806). Although his legend is not so well-known today, he was once considered among the most fearsome yōkai in Japanese history. Along with Shuten dōji and Tamamo no Mae, he is often considered one of the Nihon san dai aku yōkai, or Great Three Evil Yōkai of Japan. (Some versions of this ranking replace Ōtakemaru with Sutoku Tennō.)",,,"The Suzuka Mountains were home to a tennyo—a beautiful goddess named Suzuka Gozen. When Ōtakemaru saw her, he was enchanted by her beauty and became determined to spend a night in her company. He transformed himself into a beautiful young man, a noble of the court, and other disguises, and night after night traveled to Suzuka Gozen’s palace. But every time, his solicitations were denied by the goddess.
Frustrated by his inability to find the Ōtakemaru’s whereabouts, Tamuramaro prayed to the gods and the buddhas to help him. That night, as he dozed off, he had a vision of an old man. “To defeat Ōtakemaru you must gain the help of Suzuka Gozen,” the old man told him. Tamuramaro sent his army of 30,000 horsemen back to Kyōto and climbed the Suzuka Mountains by himself. Deep in the mountains, he came upon a palace in which lived a beautiful woman. She invited him inside, and he spent the night with her. The woman told Tamuramaro, “I came down from heaven to help you defeat the demon who haunts these mountains. I will capture him for you.” Tamuramaro realized that this beautiful woman must be Suzuka Gozen.
Suzuka Gozen led Tamuramaro through the mountains to show him the Ōtakemaru’s demon castle. She instructed him that Ōtakemaru could be defeated while he possesses the Sanmyō no ken (Kenmyōren, Daitōren, and Shōtōren: three holy swords of great power). Then they traveled back to her palace, where she laid her trap for the oni.
The night, Ōtakemaru came to her again, disguised as usual as handsome young man to ask for her love. Suzuka Gozen invited him inside, and said to him: “A warrior named Tamuramaro is coming here to kill me. Please, lend me the Sanmyō no ken so that I may defend myself.” The oni gave her Daitōren, and Shōtōren to defend herself with, but kept Kenmyōren for himself.
The following night Ōtakemaru came once again to Suzuka Gozen’s palace. Tamuramaro was waiting for him there. Ōtakemaru revealed his true form to the shōgun, transforming into a massive demon who stood over 10 meters tall, with eyes that shined like the sun and the moon. A terrible combat ensued. Heaven and earth shook with the fury of their battle. Ōtakemaru attacked Tamuramaro with sword and spear, but the shōgun was a holy warrior, protected by the thousand-armed Kannon, bodhisattva of mercy, and Bishamonten, god of war. Ōtakemaru split his body into thousands of oni, who charged at Tamuramaro. Tamuramaro took from his quiver a single holy arrow and fire it, The arrow split into one thousand arrows which in turn split into ten thousand more and impaled the oni in their faces, killing them. Just then, Ōtakemaru made a ferocious lunge at Tamuramaro. But the shōgun was faster, and he swung his blade Sohaya at the oni’s head, lopping it off.
Tamuramaro brough the oni’s head back to Kyoto for the emperor to inspect. The emperor was so pleased with the shōgun that he granted him Iga Province as a reward. Tamuramaro returned to Iga, married Suzuka Gozen, and the two of them lived happily together for many years.
Ōtakemaru’s reign of terror, however, was not over. His spirit traveled to India for a time, and eventually returned to Japan and haunted Kenmyōren. He was able to reform his body and once again became a kijin. He rebuilt his impregnable demon castle on Mount Iwate in Mutsu Province and once again he began to terrorize Japan.
Tamuramaro and Suzuka Gozen traveled to Mutsu to meet their nemesis one more time and defeat him once and for all. While Ōtakemaru was away from his castle, Tamuramaro snuck in through a secret back door that Suzuka Gozen had revealed to him in Ōtakemaru’s first demon castle. When Ōtakemaru returned, Tamuramaro was waiting for him. They did battle, and once again Tamuramaro cut Ōtakemaru’s head clean off. The oni’s head flew up into the air and landed upon Tamuramaro’s head and bit down hard. Fortunately, Tamuramaro was wearing two helmets. Though the demon head bit off and swallowed the first one, Tamuramaro was able to escape injury. Ōtakemaru’s head was once more taken back to Kyōto, where it was locked safely away in the treasury of Byōdōin.","Because of the time period and locations in which his story takes place, and the fact that his chief enemy was the shōgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, it is thought that Ōtakemaru may be a folkloric interpretation of Aterui, a chieftain of the Emishi people of northeastern Japan who waged a devastating campaign against the Yamato Japanese. His legend also serves as the basis of Aomori Prefecture’s famous Nebuta Matsuri, in which large floats depicting warriors defeating oni are parading through the streets.","Long ago an oni named Ōtakemaru terrorized travelers in the Suzuka Mountains and stole tributes intended for the emperor in Kyōto. The emperor commanded his shōgun, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, to exterminate the demon. Tamuramaro raised an army of 30,000 horsemen and entered the Suzuka Mountains. However, Ōtakemaru was powerful, and using his black magic he summoned a great storm. He covered the mountains in black clouds, making it impossible to see. Rains and winds battered the army. Lightning crashed and fire rained down from the sky onto the army. For seven long years Tamuramaro and his men roamed the mountains in search of Ōtakemaru, but could not catch him.",,

These victims often come back to the world many years later, profoundly changed by the traumatic experience. Sometimes, however, a person never returns after going missing. In these cases, the victim is often said to have been taken–or rather eaten–by an oni.

Unhappy with the situation, one night Narihira snuck into Takaiko’s room and kidnapped her. He fled into the wilds with the girl, when a terrible storm struck. They discovered a cave and sheltered there. Takaiko stayed in the far back end of the cave, and Narihira stood watch by the entrance with his bow and arrow ready. In the morning, when the storm had cleared, Narihira went to retrieve Takaiko from the cave, but she was not there.

Just then there was a splintering crack, and the ceiling tore open. An enormous foot descended into the mansion. The foot was covered in thick, bristly hair, and it was filthy. The terrified servants scrambled to gather buckets, water, and rags. They washed the foot until it was thoroughly clean. Afterwards, the giant foot ascended up through the roof and disappeared.
The following night, and every night thereafter, the same thing occurred. A booming voice would demand its foot be washed. A giant foot would crash through the roof. And the dutiful servants would wash it clean.
A few nights of this was all that Aji no Kyūnosuke could take. He ordered his servants not to wash the foot anymore. That night, the foot crashed through the ceiling and demanded to be washed as usual. When it was ignored, it thrashed around violently, destroying vast swaths of the mansion’s roof in the process.
Kyūnosuke complained to his friends about the nightly visitor and the destruction it was causing. They were very interested. One of them wanted to witness the event so badly that he offered to swap mansions with Kyūnosuke, and Kyūnosuke quickly agreed. However, after his friend moved in, the giant foot never appeared again.
There’s no definite conclusion as to what caused this strange occurrence. It’s often blamed on a mischievous tanuki, for they have magical powers and they love playing tricks on people. On the other hand, “washing your feet” is also a Japanese idiom for rehabilitating a criminal. A culprit whose “feet have been washed” can be said to have paid his debt to society.

This portrayal is not rooted in folklore however, but comes from Daiei Films’ 1968-69 yōkai movies. Nonetheless, it has caught on and remains a popular variation of ungaikyō in many productions.","Ungaikyō appears in Toriyama Sekien’s book of tsukumogami Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. Sekien based this yōkai on a mirror from an old Chinese myth. That mirror was called shōmakyō (“demon revealing mirror”). It had the ability to expose the true forms of demons masquerading as humans when they were reflected in the mirror. Shōmakyō was used by King Zhou of the Shang dynasty to reveal that his beloved consort Daji was actually a wicked nine-tailed kitsune, intent on runing his kingdom through her evil depravities. Her true form revealed, she fled the country (setting into action a chain of events that would see her eventually wind up in Japan as Tamamo no Mae). Shōmakyō was used time and time again to reveal the true nature of disguised spirits. Sekien postulated that such a mirror might pick up a little of the strangeness of each yōkai and demon it reflected, eventually becoming one itself. Perhaps the countless spirits that is has reflected over the years have slowly gained the ability to manipulate its reflections.",,,

When they hit water, ripples and a splash occur even though no rock is seen.

The sound of trees being chopped and crashing to the ground late at night comes from deep within the mountains. It can continue for some time. Occasionally voices can even be heard shouting “Ikuzo!” (the equivalent of shouting “Timber!” as the tree falls). Woodcutters sometimes feel creatures shaking their sleeping huts during the night. However in the morning, there is no sign of fallen trees or any evidence whatsoever of what could have made the noise.","Other common names for this phenomenon include furusoma (“old woodcutter”), sora kigaeshi and kara kidaoshi (which refer to trees being knocked down from the sky), and tsue tsuki (“cane strike,” as it sounds like trees being struck by walking sticks). In most of Shikoku, tengu daoshi is known as furusoma, meaning “old woodcutter.” Legend has it that the phenomenon is the work of the ghost of an old woodcutter. He was illegally cutting down trees when he was crushed to death under a falling tree. His ghost now haunts the mountains, causing phantom woodcutting sounds.","Tengu daoshi occurs all over Japan. It is known by many regional names and attributed to many supernatural forces. As the name suggests, it is often believed to be the work of tengu who make their homes deep in mountain valleys. In addition to tengu, animal yōkai are often blamed for this phenomenon. Tanuki are said to kick rocks at humans with their hind legs or slap trees with their tails, causing these mysterious sounds.

It appears as one or more (up to several hundred) reddish flames which float about in the sky. These supernatural fires are said to be created by tengu.","Tengubi descends at night from the mountains to the rivers. Often it starts as a small number of fireballs which split into hundreds of smaller flames. These flames hover above the water for some time, as if dancing. Afterwards, they return to the mountains.","In most cases, humans who witness tengubi invariably meet with disaster—usually in the form of a serious illness contracted shortly after the encounter. Because of this, locals who lives in areas where tengubi is common greatly fear this phenomenon. If a local happens to see a tengubi, they will immediately drop prone and hide. Oftentimes they will cover their heads with their shoes or sandals.","Occasionally, tengubi can he helpful to humans. During times of drought, it was common for rice farmers to secretly steal water from their neighbors by redirecting water from the canals into their own fields during the night. This caused a great deal of conflict among the people involved. However, when tengubi appeared above the canals, would-be thieves were thwarted—either out of guilty consciences or because the light from the tengubi made it impossible to sneak around.
Toriyama Sekien included this phenomenon in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro under the name taimatsu maru (taimatsu meaning “torch,” and maru being a popular suffix for boys’ names). He described it not as a tool for tengu to help with fishing, but as a way for them to hinder and interfere with the religious practices of ascetic monks.
It was a common superstition in that village not to go outside of your home on nights when tengubi appeared. If you did, it was said that you would be spirited away into the mountains. One night a particularly foolhardy young man defied the superstition. He walked out of his house, faced the tengubi, and called out, “If you can take me, come and get me!” Suddenly, a large black shape appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the young man. It picked him up and flew away into the mountains. The young man was never seen again.",Tengubi is created by kawa tengu—”river tengu” who prefer the riversides over the deep mountain valleys where tengu normally live. It is used by these tengu to catch fish at night. For this reason it is also known as tengu no gyorō (“tengu fishing”).,"Long ago, tengubi was frequently seen in the villages of Kasugai City, Aichi Prefecture. One night, a villager was caught out in the mountains in a sudden thunderstorm. It was cold, and too dark to find his way back home, so he took shelter under a tree and shivered. Before long, mysterious fires began appearing around him. Not only did they warm his chilled body up, but they provided enough light for him to find the road and make it safely back to his village.",,

It emerged from her body through the stab wound. Although the mother was dead, her soul was so driven by the need to protect her child that it got stuck in the boulder.

A priest from a nearby temple heard the crying. When he went to investigate, he discovered the newborn baby lying beside the boulder. The priest took the baby to his temple and raised him, naming him Otohachi. When Otohachi grew up he was apprenticed to a sword sharpener. After many years he became an accomplish sword sharpener as well.
One day, a samurai appeared before Otohachi and commanded him to repair his chipped katana. Otohachi was surprised by the terrible crack in the blade.

Her story takes place during the Muromachi Period, but she first appears in literature and artwork during the Edo Period, when novels and images depicting life in the red light districts were popular. Her legend is intertwined with that of the eccentric and iconoclastic Zen master Ikkyū—one of Japanese Buddhism’s most influential figures who was known for his outrageous lifestyle.",,,"Otoboshi grew up to be very beautiful. She was also intelligent and sharp-witted. Although her life was full of misfortune, she believed that her misfortunes were merely her karma—the result of things she did in her past lives. As a courtesan, she gave herself the name Jigoku (“Hell”) as a way of mocking her misfortunes. She wrapped her body in kimono decorated with skeletons, fire, and scenes from hell. She spoke with elegance and wit, and recited poetry with such grace that those who heard her were instantly charmed. And in her heart, she constantly recited the name of Buddha, hoping to achieve salvation from her sins. Jigoku’s grace, beauty, and wit quickly distinguished her from the other courtesans. Her unique name also caused her to stand out from competing courtesans who had flowery names like Hotoke gozen (“Lady Buddha”).
Jigoku quickly rose to the rank of tayū, the highest rank possible for a courtesan. Word of this strange woman caught the attention of Ikkyū, a Zen monk. He visited the Takasu pleasure district of Sakai and went to the Tamana brothel to seek out the peculiar courtesan whom he had heard so much about. When Ikkyū appeared before Jigoku, she recited a poem to him:
The poem was rich in metaphor and multilayered, playing on the word sakai (“border”) and Sakai (the city). Ikkyū did not miss what Jigoku was implying. She was asking what a monk like him, who ordinarily should not leave his temple deep in the mountains, was doing on the edge of a pleasure district—the “floating world” of sorrow and grief from which Buddhists seek escape. Intrigued, Ikkyū replied with a poem of his own:
He implied that, as a Zen priest, he has no attachment to his body—and therefore it makes no difference if he comes to a brothel. To the enlightened, the body does not truly exist, nor is there any intrinsic difference between a brothel and a temple. There are one and the same. He followed up with another poem:
Jigoku understood that Ikkyū was really explaining that he came specifically to see her, and complimenting her on her terrifying beauty and wit. Jigoku finished his poem for him:
Her poem, while playing on Buddhist themes, simultaneously implied that everyone who sees her falls in love with her.
Jigoku admitted Ikkyū into her presence. She offered him a vegetarian meal appropriate for a monk. Ikkyū refused and instead asked for sake and carp. Jigoku became suspicious. Monks were forbidden from indulging in alcohol, meat, and sex, and this man certainly did not appear to be a monk. She had girls sent to Ikkyū to test his true character. The girls sang, played drums and flute, and danced for Ikkyū. The monk enjoyed the performance and joined them in celebration.
Jigoku listened to the performance in secret from the next room. Suddenly, she noticed something odd about the shadows on the paper doors. She peeked into the room and saw that all of the dancers had turned into skeletons, reveling together in the music. When Jigoku re-entered the room, everything had turned back to normal.
Ikkyū partied until he passed out. In the middle of the night the monk awoke and went to the veranda where, having indulged too much, he vomited into the lake. When the vomit hit the water, the carp that Ikkyū had eaten turned into a live fish. Jigoku winessed this too.
The following morning Jigoku asked Ikkyū if she was dreaming, and told him about the things she saw the previous night. Ikkyu taught her about heaven and hell, and how looks can be deceiving. He explained to her:
“When are we not in a dream? When are we not skeletons? We are all just skeletons wrapped with flesh patterned male and female. When our breath expires, our skin ruptures, our sex disappears, and superior and inferior are indistinguishable. Beneath the skin of the person we caress today, there is no more than a skeleton propping up the flesh. Think about it! High and low, young and old, male and female: it is all the same. If you awaken to this one basic truth, you understand.”
Jigoku vowed to renounce her profession and become a nun, but Ikkyū told her to remain a courtesan. He told her that she should find her own way to enlightenment; that religion is hypocritical and a prostitute is more worthy than a nun.
From that moment, Jigoku became Ikkyū’s student. She remained in her brothel, and Ikkyū visited her time and time again to meditate and pray with her. She came to understand that all people are merely skeletons in bags of flesh, and she found peace. She continued to work as a prostitute, and gave generously to charity. She meditated and prayed every day, and eventually achieved enlightenment.
Like most courtesans, Jigoku became ill and died at a young age. Ikkyū was by her side at her death. Her final poem expressed her last act of compassion:
Ikkyū lay her to rest in a field as she wished, and then built a grave for her in Kumeda Temple in the nearby village of Yagi.",,"Long ago lived young girl named Otoboshi, the daughter of a samurai.

The real-life events that inspired his ghost story supposedly took place around the year 1700. Over the years, rumor mixed with folklore and fantasy, until his story was finally written down a hundred years later, in 1803’s Fukushū kidan Asaka no numa (“The Strange Tale of Revenge from Asaka Swamp”). His story was adapted into the kabuki play Iroeiri otogizōshi (“Colorful Fairy Tales”) shortly after that. He remained a popular figure throughout the Edo period.",,,"The ghost of Kohada Koheiji is said to jealously guard its status as the best ghost actor. To this day, actors who perform Iroeiri otogizōshi or other adaptations of his story are haunted by strange occurrences, suspicious accidents, and even injuries.
Koheiji believed this to be his last chance to make it as an actor, and so he did everything he could to make his role believable. He studied the faces of dead, making note of the way their muscles fell limp and eyes stared blankly. He copied their rigid, lifeless poses. He practiced speaking in a haunting voice, and walking with an eerie gracefulness. His hard work paid off. His acting was widely acclaimed. He was suddenly the talk of the countryside. The other actors in his troupe admitted finally that Koheiji was good at one thing: being a ghost.
Koheiji’s was married to a woman named Otsuka. Otsukda had been the widow of the disgraced Ikushima Hanroku, an actor who was executed for stabbing and killing the great Ichikawa Danjūrō I publicly on stage. Koheiji loved Otsuka deeply, but she was embarrassed by her husband and thought him a fool. She fell out of love with Koheiji, and into the arms of another performer in the Morita-za: a taiko player named Adachi Sakurō. While Koheiji was away acting in the countryside, Sakurō lived in Koheiji’s house in Edo with Otsuka, pretending to be the master of the house. Eventually, Otsuka asked Sakurō to get rid of Koheiji so that they could be together forever.
At the time, Koheiji was performing in rural Asaka (in present-day Fukushima Prefecture). Sakurō’s brother, a bandit named Unpei, lived nearby, and Sakurō would acquire his help in getting rid of Koheiji. Sakurō traveled to Asaka. Koheiji was surprised and delighted that his troupemate had come to join his performance. Sakurō played the drums while Koheiji played a ghost, and the audience was highly entertained. Among them was the local magistrate, who awarded Koheiji a sum of five golden ryō (a very gracious sum) for his performance. Between shows, Sakurō and Unpei planned the murder.
One day, the performance was canceled due to rain. Sakurō invited Koheiji out to the swamp to go fishing. Once they were far away from any observers, Sakurō struck Koheiji with his fishing rod and knocked him off the boat and into the swamp. Then he thrust his head down into the water and held him there until Koheiji drowned. His body sank to the bottom of the swamp.
Sakurō fled the swamp and went to Unpei’s secret hideout. Unpei was there, and he told Sakurō that his “guest” had already arrived. He took Sakurō into the next room, where Koheiji’s waterlogged body lay on the floor. Sakurō was shocked. “How did that get here?” he asked. Unpei said that it was already there when he arrived. Sakurō opened up Koheiji’s sleeve and took out the five golden ryō which had been paid to Koheiji. “Hah! Now his money and his wife are mine!”
Suddenly, Koheiji’s body rattled and rolled over. With hands as cold as ice and strong as iron, he grabbed Sakurō’s wrist. Sakurō screamed and tried to get free, but the corpse was locked onto his arm. He tugged and yanked his wrist harder and harder until the corpse flopped on top of his own body. Koheiji’s eyes popped open, and he locked his gaze upon Sakurō.
Sakurō screamed. Unpei heard this and rushed into the room. The corpse was lying on top of his brother, eyes locked in a vengeful stare. Sakurō was paralyzed with fear. Unpei tried to pull the corpse off of his brother, but it wouldn’t budge. Unpei drew his sword. He lopped off Koheiji’s head in a single stroke. The head rolled across the room, but the rest of him still gripped Sakurō’s wrist tightly. Finally, Unpei cut each of the hand’s fingers off individually. Sakurō was freed. Without a moment’s delay Sakurō fled out the door. He didn’t stop until he reached Edo.
When Sakurō arrived at to the Kohada residence, he called out for Otsuka. In a panic he rapidly told her everything that happened: the murder, the ghost, the icy cold grip of the corpse and its hateful eyes. Otsuka was confused. “Koheiji just got home a little while ago. He was tired, so he’s resting in the back room.” Sakurō couldn’t believe it. He took Otsuka’s hand and timidly crept into the house, towards the room where Koheiji was sleeping.
When Sakurō entered the bedroom, he saw someone sleeping behind a folding screen. He tried to pull the screen away, but a pale, blue-tinged hand grabbed the end of it and held it fast. Sakurō did not give up. He pulled as hard as he could. There was a popping sound. The folding screen crashed to the floor along with Sakurō. Five severed fingers rolled around on the floor and instantly began to rot. The sickening smell of death filled the room. But there was no body behind the folding screen. A tiny flame floated up into the air and flew out the window. Sakurō was terrified, however Otsuka was undisturbed. If anything, she seemed relieved that Koheiji was finally dead. She soon arranged for a funeral, and then for a wedding.
Sakurō and Otsuka lived as husband and wife. Half a year passed without any further disturbances. They forgot about Koheiji altogether. Then, one night Sakurō awoke to find another man in the bed between himself and Otsuka. He leaped to his feet in a rage, but there was no one there. From that moment, Sakurō began to doubt Otsuka’s fidelity.
One night, while returning home from drinking late at night, Sakurō saw a figure climb into his bedroom window. When he peeked in, he saw another man in bed with Otsuka. In a drunken rage, he ran into the house and drew his sword. Otsuka awoke in a panic and without thinking, she raised her hand in defense. In doing so, she grabbed the sword’s blade. All five of her fingers were severed. The fingers fell to the floor and rotted away, filling the room with the smell of death. The mysterious stranger was nowhere to be seen. A cackling laugh could be heard from above them. It was Koheiji’s voice! Otsuka lost her mind, and fell to the floor in shock.
Every night, the ghost returned to haunt them. As the haunting continued, Sakurō began to lose his mind too. In life, Kohada Koheiji the had so perfected his ghost act that it was indistinguishable from the real thing. In death, Koheiji’s performance was terrifying and sublime. Otsuka never recovered from her madness, and died soon after.
Otsuka’s treatments had cost Sakurō nearly everything he owned, including the five golden ryō he had stolen from Koheiji. Sakurō gave up his few remaining coins to hold a funeral for Otsuka. However, the priest he hired was a con artist, and ran off with the last of Sakurō’s money.
Penniless and insane, Sakurō was forced to live as a beggar. One day, he thought he saw the priest who had tricked him and stolen his money. Sakurō chased after him, but the priest swung his staff and beat Sakurō severely, knocking him off the road and into a pond. Then the bruised, soaked Sakurō realized that it was not the same priest after all. He crawled out of the pond and apologized, but the priest struck Sakurō over and over, beating him nearly to death. Some strangers broke up the fight.
They took Sakurō back to his house to rest, but his wounds were severe and he fell into a fevered insanity. All night his neighbors could hear him crying in delirium. He never woke up. When they found him the next day, Sakurō’s was bloated and discolored—just like that of a drowned corpse.
Some time later, the great Ichikawa Danjūrō II heard of the story of the famous ghost actor Kohada Koheiji’s tragic murder. He pitied him, and offered prayers in his honor. As he prayed, the drowned ghost of Koheiji appeared behind him.
“Koheiji. You were only ever good at being a ghost,” said Danjūrō.
With that final recognition, Koheiji’s ghost seemed content, and vanished.",,"During the time when Ichikawa Danjūrō II commanded the stage there lived a third-rate actor named Kohada Koheiji. He was part of the Morita-za theater troupe and studied under master Unagi Tarōbē. Koheiji was a terrible actor. On top of that he was unattractive; he had pale, languid skin, sunken, flat eyes, and disheveled hair. He was unable to land even the smallest roles in any of Edo’s kabuki productions. Koheiji’s manager felt sorry for him, and resorted to bribing and begging to find something—anything—for the struggling actor to perform. Finally, he landed a part for Koheiji with a traveling show in the countryside, where the audiences were far less demanding than they were in Edo. Because his poor appearance allowed the producers to save money on makeup, Koheiji was cast as a ghost.",,

The monster fell, and Genzō was able to get a closer look at the monster’s true form: a bleached white skeleton inside a loose bag of skin, with no meat at all.","Tales about nikusui are cautionary tales, warning young men to keep away from strange women. A beautiful woman could “snuff out a man’s fire,” draining his money and distracting him from more important things. Less metaphorically, there was a real folk belief in a sickness called jinkyo—weakness in men caused by the loss of semen. Overindulgence in sexual activity was believed to drain a man of his virility, leaving him weak and anxious. Losing too much semen could even be lethal. Therefore, sexual promiscuity was frowned upon not only due to social mores, but for health reasons too. Nikusui represent the dangers of young men overindulging in their lust.","A hunter named Genzō was hunting late at night on Mt. Hatenashi. All of a sudden, a beautiful young woman of about 18 or 19 years appeared before him and laughed with an eerie “ho ho.” Though it was night, she carried no lantern. The young woman asked to borrow Genzō light. Genzō had a very bad feeling about her. He carried a blessed bullet with a prayer to Amida Buddha incribed upon. He loaded that bullet into his rifle and threatened the girl. She fled into the darkness, Genzō continued on his way.",,

It occurs at night when wolves are active and hunting. Most folktales involving senbiki no ōkami fit a specific pattern. Usually, a traveler is chased by wolves on the road at night, and the only escape available is to climb high up into a nearby tree. However, the wolves start to climb on to each other’s backs, forming a living ladder. In this way, they are able to reach even the highest branches of the trees. However, the wolf ladder is one wolf too short to reach the traveler. The wolves call for their leader to complete the ladder and catch their prey. The leader of the wolves is a particularly large and canny bakemono, who climbs the ladder to face the traveler. However, the traveler is able to fend off the leader of the wolves with a sword. The following day, the wolves’ leader is traced back to the house of a person who is now lying in bed with an injury received the previous night; it is revealed that the person was actually the bakemono in disguise, responsible for the senbiki no ōkami and the deaths of many people.",,,"A pregnant woman was traveling to Nahari and had to cross a mountain pass during the night. As misfortune would have it, deep in the mountains she fell ill with labor pains. To make matters worse, a pack of wolves was nearby. Just then, a courier showed up. He helped the woman climb safely into a tree, out of reach of the pack of wolves. He, too, climbed high up into the branches to guard the woman until morning.
The wolves gathered around the base of the tree. They leaped high into the air, but they could not reach the courier or the woman. The wolves clawed at the bark, but they could not climb the tree.
Then, a strange thing happened: the wolves began to climb on to each other’s shoulders and make a living ladder. One by one the stack of wolves grew higher and higher. It almost reached the spot where the courier and the woman were clinging for their lives. The courier drew his wakizashi and slashed at the wolves, but he could not reach them, just as they could not reach him.
Then, one of the wolves spoke: “Summon the blacksmith’s wife from Sakihama!” The other wolves bayed and howled. After some time, another figure appeared. It was a wolf of enormous size, wearing an iron kettle as a helmet. The great white wolf climbed up the living ladder towards the courier and the woman. When it was within striking distance, the courier struck his wakizashi downwards with all of his might. There was a loud crack as his blade split the kettle. At the same time, a human-like howl erupted from the giant wolf. A moment later, all of the wolves vanished.
When morning came and human travelers appeared on the road, the courier helped the woman down from the tree and asked a passerby to escort her to Nahari. Then the courier searched the ground where the wolves had been. He discovered a trail of blood.
The courier followed the trail of blood all the way to Sakihama, to the door of the blacksmith’s house. The courier knocked on the door and asked the blacksmith if his wife was home. The blacksmith replied that she had suffered a head injury and was sleeping. The courier entered the house. He went into the bedroom, found the sleeping wife, and cut her to pieces with his sword. Where the woman’s form had been now lay the corpse of a great, white-furred wolf. Underneath the floorboards of the house, the courier found countless human skeletons scattered about, including the bones of the blacksmith’s real wife.
Today in Sakihama, a memorial tower dedicated to the blacksmith’s wife still stands. And they say that the descendants of the blacksmith all have strangely spiked hair, like that of a wolf.","This phenomenon appears in many stories about wolves, and is found in legends all across Japan. There are many variations, but they tend to follow a pattern very similar to the one described above. Folklorists consider it to be a very old tale which symbolizes wolves’ natural tendency to cooperate in large groups, their intelligence, and their athletic abilities.",One famous example of this phenomenon comes from Kōchi Prefecture.,,

They are high ranking and holy trees, so they belong in the gardens of temples, shrines, and public places; not private gardens. Planting a ginkgo is one’s own garden was sacrilegious. In addition, they grow tall very quickly and can cause a house to become dark, which can interrupt or alter the flow of in’yō (yin and yang) energy. If the roots grow underneath the house, they could spread sickness and misfortune to a family for many generations. Residents in houses with ginkgo trees would become sick and die much sooner than those without.

A doctor came and gave the man medicine, and bathed him to remove the smell. Almost immediately he began to feel better. When the young man told the doctor about the giant serpent he had seen in the mountains, the doctor replied that it was not a serpent. It must have been a nomori.

They are often depicted cavorting with other tsukumogami in illustrations of the night parade of one hundred demons.","A narigama’s most amazing talent is the ability to predict the future. As its name suggest, it begins to emit sounds when it is heated over a fire. When the water inside begins to boil, a narigama will begin to ring or cry like an animal. Depending on the sound that it emits, it is possible to know whether the weather will be rainy or fair. An onmyōji or a priest can even divine good and bad fortunes based on the sounds the narigama makes as its contents are boiled.","The Edo Period book Kansō kidan also describes Renjo as haunting kettles. According to this book, when a narigama begins acting up if you stand three shaku (about nintey centimeters) away from it and loudly say the name “Renjo,” the fires will descend into the earth, beneath the house. The haunting will end, and from then on the household will be blessed with good fortune.
At the Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama Prefecture, priests still practice a folk ritual called narukama which involves boiling a kettle and examining the sounds it emits to predict good and bad fortunes. According to the Okayama tradition, the ritual’s powers derive not from Renjo, but from an ancient oni named Ura who long ago terrorized the region. Eventually Ura was slain, but even in death his head cried out nonstop. The flesh was eaten away to the bone by dogs, and still cries emitted from his empty skull. Ura’s head was buried beneath the shrine’s kitchen in order to silence it, but he could still be heard groaning beneath the kettles. Finally, a priestess named Aso hime offered a sacrifice of food to Ura’s restless spirit. This quieted him, and he changed his ways. Since then, Ura’s spirit has used the crying kettle to foretell good and bad fortunes to the Kibitsu Shrine priests.
Toriyama Sekien may have based his description on the narukama ritual, altering the history and connecting it to ancient China in order to make it seem more authentic.","Illustrations of narigama appear in some of the oldest hyakki yagyō emaki picture scrolls, although they appear without a name or description. Later, Toriyama Sekien included it in Hyakki tsurezure bukuro along with a brief history. According to Sekien, the narigama was first described in the Hakutaku zu, a record of all the supernatural creatures in the world describing their strengths and weaknesses.

Like mokugyo, Daruma is a symbol of wakefulness. Daruma is said to have meditated for nine years straight without sleeping. Due to their shared symbolism, Sekien combined these two figures of wakefulness into one tsukumogami.","Mokugyo have multiple purposes in a Buddhist temple. They are used to keep the rhythm when chanting sutras. They are also used to keep people awake during meditation.

Sekien suggests that if even a dog has a buddha nature, then perhaps a hossu used for nine years by a Zen master might also realize its buddha nature. The nine years mentioned by Sekien is a reference to the nine years that Daruma (aka Bodhidharma), the founder of Zen Buddhism, spent in meditation.","Hossu are Buddhist tools originating in India. Flies and other insects can be quite distracting and troublesome to meditating priests and monks. Swatting and killing even a fly or a mosquito is a sin in Buddhism. Thus, a hossu can be used to gently shoo away insects which land on their bodies or bite them without harming the insect.

Traditionally, when silk was made it was taken to a river and beaten with a wooden board called a kinuta to soften it. The name kinutanuki is a portmanteau connecting the beating action of tanuki’s bellies with silk, and literally combining the words kinuta and tanuki.
Sekien’s description also references a famous type of Japanese silk known as Hachijō silk. Written with different kanji, hachijō also means “eight tatami mats.” According to folklore, tanuki possess the ability to enlarge their scrotums up to eight tatami mats in size, and morph them into various shapes. This wordplay doubles down on the association of silk with tanuki.","Toriyama Sekien invented kinutanuki for his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro.

It is similar to the English phrase “to count your chickens before they are hatched.”","Mujina are known to be tricksters, dressing up in various human costumes and masquerading as people.

A moment later, the old man heard somebody enter the house. He slid the closet door open a crack and peeked into the room. He saw a woman with long hair—only, her body was covered in scales, and she had webbed hands and feet! He realized that the creature who had been watching him was an umi nyōbō.
The umi nyōbō was carrying a red-faced newborn human baby in one arm. The old man watched as she entered the kitchen and began to snoop around. She approached a barrel of pickled fish which had a heavy stone placed on top of it to keep the lid sealed. While still carrying the human baby, she effortlessly lifted and tossed away the stone with one hand. She grabbed webbed handful after webbed handful of picked fish and gleefully swallowed them whole. Her sharp teeth glimmered. When she had eaten all of the fish, she bit into the human baby and quickly devoured that too.
The old man was paralyzed with fear, and could not look away.
The umi nyōbō finished up all the remaining bits of pickled fish and human baby, then began to scan the house with her fierce eyes. “Where is that old man I saw in here earlier? I really could use something to clean my palate!”

Yosobei was aware that a kitsune lived in the area, and he was prepared to resist her temptations. When Osan gitsune approached him, he pretended to be seduced and followed her back to her house. There, he burned her with fire. Her disguised faltered, and her true form was revealed. Osan gitsune begged for her life. Yosobei agreed to release her if she swore never to do harm again. She agreed, and she fled the area. Several years later, a man fon pilgrimage to Iga encountered a beautiful young woman traveling alone on the roads. She approached him and asked if Yosobei was still living. The man told her that yes, Yosobei was still alive. The young woman explain, “Oh god! How terrifying!” and fled into the woods.",,"In Hiroshima, Osan gitsune is said to have lived near Eba.

She begged for forgiveness, and promised him that if he would let her go, the following night she would transform into a daimyō’s procession—a rare sight indeed! The merchant agreed and released her. Sure enough, the following night, a splendid daimyō’s procession approached the city. The merchant was thoroughly impressed by the splendor and approached the procession to praise the kitsune. However, this happened to be a real daimyō’s procession. The daimyō was offended by the merchant’s impudence and had him beheaded.",,

She replied from out the woods that he had left it next to his shed. When some food was stolen from the village, Otohime instructed the villagers the name and the location of the thief. Thanks to Otohime’s knowledge, eventually there were no wicked people left in the village.
One autumn, a farmer’s vegetable garden was torn up by wild animals. The farmer feared that he would run out of food during the winter. So he set some traps deep in the woods to catch the wild beasts that were destroying his crops.
Not long after that, the farmer heard a voice deep in the forest. It was a call for help. It was the unmistakable voice of Otohime!
The man hurried into the woods. He climbed towards where he heard the voice. Finally, he reached the place where he had set his traps. There, caught in one of his snares, was the body of a large, beautiful, white-furred fox. But it was too late; the fox was dead.
The voice of Otohime was never again heard in the village.",,"Long ago, there was a goddess named Otohime. She lived in a mountain called Hatahikiyama.

He had a powerful personality, and humans possessed by this kitsune would adopt a number of his mannerisms.",,"People possessed by Otora gitsune exhibit a few telltale signs.Firstly, they would experience an excess of discharge from their left eye. Their left leg would also begin to ache unexpectedly. They would also begin to talk endlessly about the Battle of Nagashino, that time they got shot, and other personal adventures that they never actually experienced.","Victims possessed by Otora gitsune could usually be exorcised by priests, however there were times when his possession was exceptionally hard to get rid of. In those cases, victims were recommended to travel to the Yamazumi Shrine in present-day Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture for an exorcism. This is because Yamazumi Shrine is famously dedicated to wolves. Many of the rituals performed there invoke the power of wolves in order to chase away sickness and evil spirits. Foxes are said to be terrified of dogs and wolves, and so an exorcism involving them would be particularly effective at curing kitsune tsuki.
Otora gitsune became one-eyed as a result of the Battle of Nagashino. He was observing the battle from his grove when a stray bullet struck his left eye.  There are a few stories about how he lost his left leg. Some say that he was eavesdropping on a meeting of generals deep in Nagashino Castle when his shadow was cast against the paper sliding door. The lord of the castle saw the shadow, and believing it to be a spy, slashed his sword and severed the kitsune’s leg. Another version says that one day he transformed into a crow, perched on a wall, and began cawing loudly. This annoyed a famous bowman who lived nearby, and the bowman shot an arrow at the crow, severing its leg.
Otora gitsune was killed by a hunter while he was napping on the banks of the Sai River in Nagano Prefecture. However, his legacy was carried on by his progeny. After his death, his grandchildren took up the name Otora gitsune, and continued to possess people, telling their grandfather’s story through human mouths.","Otora gitsune lived in the Inari shrine grove at Nagashino Castle. After the Battle of Nagashino, Nagashino Castle was burnt to the ground. Its Inari shrine was abandoned and never rebuit. The kitsune who lived there became enraged and turned his vengeance against the locals by pranking them. His first target was the daughter of a wealthy family: a woman named Otora. It is from Otora that the kitsune got his name. From then Otora gitsune continued to possess villager after villager, causing mischief across the region.",,,

Frequently this take the form of a mysterious and deadly fever. These victims join the ranks of the shichinin misaki, replacing the spirit responsible for killing them. Some say that the replaced spirit is then finally able to attain Nirvana. Thus, the number of spirits always remains fixed at seven.","There are a number of theories about how this self-perpetuating group began. Because they are usually encountered near water, it is said that they may be the ghosts of drowning victims. Some theories describe them as the spirits of Taira soldiers who died in a boar trap while fleeing their enemies during the Genpei War. Others attribute them to the spirits of seven wicked priests who were murdered by a group of townspeople they were tormenting. Others say they are the spirits of seven women pilgrims who were thrown overboard at sea and drowned.
The most popular story about the shichinin misaki comes from Tōsa Province (present day Kōchi Prefecture) during the Sengoku Period. Kira Chikazane, a senior retainer and nephew of Chōsokabe Motochika. During a crisis of succession within the Chōsobake clan, Chikazane opposed his lord Motochika. As a result, he was later ordered to commit seppuku. Chikazane’s seven retainers also followed him into death by suicide. After that, strange occurrences were reported around the graves of Chikazane and his retainers. These were attributed to their restless, vengeful spirits.
Hearing the story of the shichinin misaki, Motochika performed services to appease the restless spirits of Chikazane and his retainers. He built a shrine in Chikazane’s name, which still stands today (the Kira Shrine in Kōchi City); however, none of these had any effect at stopping the vengeance of the shichinin misaki.
Even today, the shichinin misaki are said to haunt Western Japan and Shikoku, and Kōchi City in particular. Traffic accidents and other strange occurrences are blamed on the restless spirits of the shichinin misaki.","The word misaki (御先) means “one who goes before,” and has a number of nuanced meanings. One of these refers to the retainers and servants who would travel in front of a noble or priest’s procession. Another refers to divine animals, particularly ravens, foxes, monkeys, who acted as messengers in the service of higher ranking spirits. Finally, it can refer to spirits (bōrei) of those who died unnatural deaths, and who are able to possess and control the living. Misaki (岬) can also refer to a cape or a peninsula, which might describe why the shichinin misaki are so frequently encountered at the borders between land and sea.",,,

They merely dance about in wild and ritualistic movements like the dances in which they were once used as holy instruments.,,"Suzuhiko hime is a creation of Toriyama Sekien, and first appears in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. Everything about this yōkai, from the meaning of its name, to what Sekien intended for it to do, can only be inferred from his brief description of it.
Sekien’s description of suzuhiko hime refers to a famous scene from Japanese mythology. Amaterasu, the sun goddess, had a violent quarrel with her brother Suzano’o, the god of storms, and hid herself from the other gods in the cave Ama no Iwato. Without the sun, everything became cold and dark. The gods gathered outside of the cave and begged Amaterasu to come out, but she refused. Eventually, Ame no Uzume, the goddess of dawn and revelry, came up with a plan. She stood upon an upturned tub and performed a wild, erotic dance, stripping naked and baring herself to the other gods. Their loud, uproarious cheering could be heard by Amaterasu deep inside the cave. Eventually her curiosity got the better of her, and she left the cave to see what the commotion was about. The other gods quickly blocked the cave entrance so she could not go back inside, and light was returned to the heavens and the earth.
Ame no Uzume’s performance is said to be the origin of kagura, the sacred music and dance of Shintō rituals. And kagura in turn indirectly serves as the origin of this yōkai.","Bells have been used since ancient times in Shintō rituals to calm the human soul as well as repel evil spirits. Most importantly, they are meant to attract the attention of the gods and call forth their presence. Although it is not specifically stated, it is possible that suzuhiko hime, like other tsukumogami, are born out of old tools that are no longer in service, animating themselves from the desire to be useful once again.",,,

They woke before dawn to practice chanting. They spent their mornings copying scripture and meditating. They spent their afternoons begging for alms in the villages. One of the most important rules that monks had to live by was to never take a life. As part of this rule they were forbidden from eating meat. Of course, this did not necessarily mean that every monk was a strict vegetarian. Sinful clergy and their supernatural punishment is a common theme among yōkai folklore.","One of the earliest accounts of niwatori no sō is found in an 18th century illustrated book of yōkai tales called Ehon yōkai kidan by Okada Gyokuzan. A monk stole a chicken from a neighbor’s yard and ate it. When his neighbor noticed that one of his chickens was missing, he questioned the monk. The monk grew outraged. He pointed out his shaved head. He pointed out his monk’s robes. He said that no monk would ever stoop to something like stealing, let alone eating a chicken. He lectured his neighbor about compassion and charity. But as he spoke, suddenly from his throat came a loud “cockadooledoo!” An instant later, a chicken’s head erupted from his mouth, and a feathery tail sprouted from his back.

In addition, suppon were known for their tenacity. It was said that if one bite you, it would never let go. Accordingly, their ghosts were believed to be particularly tenacious, and their curses were especially hard to break.","Suppon no yūrei haunt humans who are involved in the catching, selling, and eating of suppon. Their victims are usually people who have eaten a great amount of suppon meat, or else the owners of bars and restaurants who have served large numbers of suppon to their customers.",There are a number of ways in which a suppon no yūrei can haunt its victims. One common method is to manifest as another yōkai—a gigantic monk called a taka nyūdō—and repeatedly terrorize the offending human. Another common method is to possess their victim and cause them to take on facial and body features resembling a softshelled turtle.,"Suppon have been a delicacy in the far east for thousands of years.

They are so shy that they spend their entire lives buried under the ground. If you should dig one up, it will bestow a curse of shame on you, and something terribly shameful or embarrassing will happen to you. Because hajikkaki’s name evokes the same feelings of shame, it’s possible that it was meant to be an artistic interpretation or reinvention of shahyōchū.","Hajikkaki appear in a number of old yokai scrolls, such as the Bakemono zukushi emaki.

They roam cities and streets looking for men (especially young monks) to make into their victims.,"Men who become enchanted by a hinoenma are quickly ruined. The hinoenma feeds on their virility and their lifeblood, causing them to become weaker and poorer. In the end, the man dies, and the hinoenma moves on to find another victim.","Hinoenma is a Buddhist term warning about the dangers of beautiful women. Sex with women was viewed as a sin for priests because it was a worldly, carnal pleasure which distracted them from the path of spirituality. Phrases like “bodhisattva on the outside, yasha on the inside” were meant to remind monks that no matter how pleasing a woman looked, her true nature was as dangerous as a demon. This misogyny had multiple implications. Women were considered dangerous both to worldly status and wealth, as well as to spiritual health and religious pursuits. Women eat men’s food, spend men’s money, and drive men into financial and social ruin. On top of that, they force men to focus on worldly things such as sexual desires and material wealth (in order to maintain the extravagant lifestyles women demand), providing barriers to spiritual enlightenment. In other words, if you give a woman your heart, she will steal your soul.
The name hinoenma itself carries multiple interpretations. Literally translated, the name means “flying fate demon,” Fate in this case refers to the Buddhist concept of nidana, the cause-and-effect chain and birth-death cycle which links all things in the universe. Fate demon means a creature from Buddhist cosmology who tries to disrupt a person’s spiritual progression. Specifically it refers to Mara, the demon king who tried to disrupt the Buddha’s quest for enlightenment by tempting him with beautiful women.
Written with different characters, hinoenma can mean “fiery Enma,” referring to the king of hell—a hint at what awaits monks who allow themselves to be tempted by women. The name also evokes the phrase hinoe uma—the year of the fire horse—which occurs every 60 years according to the Chinese calendar. Women born in these years were said to be destined to ruin their husbands—a superstition which stems from the legend of Yaoya Oshichi.",East Asian folklore is full of cautionary tales in which hinoenma have used their beauty and charm to destroy men. The falls of three of China’s great dynasties are attributed to yōkai women. Mo Xi was said to be responsible for the collapse of the Xia Dynasty. Daji was said to be responsible for the collapse of the Shang Dynasty. Bao Si was said to be responsible for the collapse of the Western Zhou Dynasty.,"Yaoya Oshichi is the origin of a Japanese superstition about women born in the year of the fire horse. Oshichi was born in Edo in 1666, the year of the fire horse. During the Tenna Era, a great fire erupted at Daienji. Watching the fire, she saw a temple page named Ikuta Shōnosuke and fell in love at first sight. A year later, she attempted to set fire to Daienji in hopes that she would see him again. She was caught, and was burnt at the stake for arson. Since then, people believe that women born in the year of the fire horse are destined to have furious tempers and eventually destroy their husbands by consuming all that they own. In a testament to the superstition’s continued existence, the most recent year of the fire horse—1966—saw a 25% drop in births compared to the previous and following years. Supposedly weddings have even been cancelled by superstitious families upon finding out that the bride was born in the year of the fire horse.",,

His story is a famous example of umatsuki—possession by a horse spirit.,,,"Gradually, Chōjirō’s horses began to dwindle, and consequently so did his stock of pickled horse meat. One the day that his supply of meat ran out, Chōjirō selected an old horse that was no longer capable of working. He slaughtered and ate it. That was the moment Chōjirō’s life changed. From then on, he was haunted by the old horse’s ghost.
Every night, the old horse appeared before Chōjirō in his dreams and snapped at his throat. Further, every evening at the very minute that Chōjirō slaughtered the horse, it’s vengeful ghost would appear before him. It would force itself down his throat and into his stomach, where it would violently thrash about.
Chōjirō’s suffering was unbearable. He developed a high fever and began to hallucinate. He screamed and babbled, confessing all of his life’s sins in painful delirium. Doctors examined him and priests prayed for him, but nothing helped. He descended into madness and his condition deteriorated.
One hundred days after his haunting began, Chōjirō finally succumbed to the horse’s curse. When he died, it is said that his body was bent like that of an old horse who had spent a lifetime carrying heavy loads.","Shio no Chōjirō’s story is an old and well known tale with many variations. Perhaps it’s most famous appearance is in the Edo Period collection of illustration stories Ehon hyakumonogatari, however it was a well known tale before then, with variations all over Japan. It may have been inspired in part by famous performance magician who lived in the late 17th century named Shioya Chōjirō. Shioya Chōjirō could perform sword swallowing and other tricks, but was best known for his mastery of of donbajutsu (“horse swallowing technique”) in which he would swallow a live horse before an audience. Illustrations of his performances appear to have been used as the basis for his illustration in Ehon hyakumonogatari.","Long ago in Oshio no Ura, Kaga Province lived a very wealthy man named Chōjirō. Chōjirō was quite fond of eating meat—a practice which was taboo in feudal Japan. His household kept over 300 horses.

Specifically the term refers to low ranking, wild kitsune that do not have a divine soul or serve as messengers of the gods. They are particularly known for transforming into humans. In folktales where humans are tormented, tricked, or possessed by kitsune, the culprit is almost always a nogitsune.","Nogitsune are cautious creatures with a keen danger sense. They dislike bright light, and hide from the sun during the daytime. They are also afraid of bladed objects, and will avoid swords and knives. They are frightened of dogs as well. A nogitsune disguised as a human might accidentally reveal their true form when startled by a barking dog.","Nogitsune are notorious tricksters. One of their favorite activities is transforming in order to trick foolish humans. They use their power to scare people, and often to steal things from them as well. In order to change its shape, a nogitsune requires a magical focus of some kind; usually a bone from a cow or a horse.","Nogitsune are able to recognize signs of human activity. They generally hide from humans when possible. However, they like to sneak into human-inhabited areas at night to steal some of their favorite foods: wax candles, lamp oil, lacquer, alcohol, and fried tofu.
Some types kitsune are viewed as holy animals; nogitsune are not one of these types. They are low-ranking members of the kitsune family, and do not act as divine messengers or serve Inari. Despite this, they seem to be comfortable in their position and don’t aspire to increase their standing.
Kitsunetsuki—possession by a fox spirit—is also commonly performed by nogitsune. Sometimes it is to punish humans they don’t like, other times it is just for the nogitsune’s own amusement. Women are a favorite target. This is sometimes said to be because women are weaker and easier to possess, but it is also because nogitsune can feed off of a woman’s life force.
Despite these conflicts with humans, nogitsune do occasionally interact positively with people. There are many tales of wild kitsune returning favors to those who are kind to them. There are even stories about men happily marrying nogitsune disguised as beautiful women. Unfortunately these stories almost always end in tragedy when the disguise is discovered. Humans occasionally ask nogitsune for favors. However, nogitsune are notoriously unreliable. If you ask a one to protect an object, it will only do so for a short time before it forgets its promise and wanders off.
Yakan are magical beasts from Chinese Buddhist scripture. The term literally means “wild dogs,” and their description can be found in various scriptures. They are small and cunning. They are yellow in color, and resemble small dogs with fluffy tails. They can change their shape, so their true form is unknown. They live in packs, and cry out at night like wolves. In the original Sanskrit, the animal referred to is the jackal. Jackals linger around burial grounds and eat carrion, and so they were viewed as wicked animals and servitors of evil gods. When Buddhism was transmitted to China, because jackals do not exist in China, the animal was not understood. They were assumed to be a creature similar to foxes, martens, or wild dogs. When Buddhism was brought to Japan, yakan was assumed to be a fox, and became synonymous with kitsune. Thus, the wicked deeds performed by jackals in Indian folklore came to be associated with foxes in Japanese folklore.","Nogitsune are known by many different names. The most common one—yako—is simply another reading of the kanji in its name. The name yakan (野干) is more archaic, and has its origins in a different animal.",,,

Shinigami are particularly fond of possessing wicked people, however anyone unfortunate enough to see a shinigami is doomed to suffer an unnatural and violent death.","Local areas have many different superstitions regarding shinigami and how to deal with them.

Upon returning home, you must have a cup of tea or a bowl of rice and lie down to sleep, or else the shinigami will possess you.","Shinigami are related to a common folk belief that evil begets evil. If a murder or a suicide takes place in a certain area, there is sure to be another murder or suicide in that same area soon. Bloodshed and tragedy can repeat over and over again until an area is ritually purified and the souls of any victims appeased. This theme is present in ancient legends such as the Tale of the Heikei, to medieval ghost stories, and even modern urban legends and film. Shinigami are a key part of this cycle; the souls of the wicked dead call to the souls of the wicked living, goading them to commit further atrocities.

When they do so, their host gains the tenko’s power of clairvoyance, and is able to correctly predict any future event.","Kitsune monogatari, part of the Edo Period essay collection Kyūsensha manpitsu explains that kitsune are divided into two categories: zenko (good foxes) and nogitsune (wild foxes). Tenko are one of the five kinds of good kitsune. The others are kinko (gold foxes), ginko (silver foxes), kuroko (black foxes), and byakko (white foxes).
Another Edo Period document, Zen’an zuihitsu, defines four categories of kitsune. Nogitsune are the lowest ranking; these are the most wicked, and also the least magical. Kiko (spirit foxes) are higher ranking kitsune who are no longer confined to physical bodies and exist as spirits. Kūko (void foxes) are the second highest rank, possessing twice as much power as kiko. Finally, tenko are the top ranking kitsune, possessing magical powers on par with the gods.","Kitsune folklore originates in the folklore of ancient China, but has been heavily adapted by Japanese writers. In China, foxes were believed to transform into human women, and then use sex to drain men’s life force. A one hundred year old fox would appear as a youthful young beauty, while a thousand year old fox would appear as an insatiable whore. The idea that upon reaching one thousand years, a fox would cease to torment humans and become good, divine spirits also goes back to Chinese folklore, although it is worth noting that in order to achieve that rank, it must first feed off of human life force for one thousand years.",,,

A tenko can become a kūko after reaching three thousand years of age. Upon achieving this rank, a kitsune takes on a much more human-like appearance. They lose their tails entirely, although their ears still resemble a fox’s. They do not have physical bodies, and exist as being of pure spirit. They are telepathic and clairvoyant, and can even see into the future. Their level of magical power is the highest it will ever be: on par with the gods.","Although they are the oldest and most powerful form of kitsune, kūko are only the second-highest ranking kitsune, after tenko. This is because after three thousand years they have reached a sort of retirement age where they are no longer working in the service of Inari—whereas younger kitsune still actively serve the gods. A kūko’s duties are more like that of a privy council member or a venerated elder.","When kūko interact with human beings, it is only to do good deeds. They might increase the prosperity of a temple or a household. They might help a good and honest person achieve fame for their skills. And they might possess a pure-hearted but foolish person in order to teach him how to improve his life. When a kūko possesses a human, it does not cause mental disorder or sickness in the way that is commonly associated with kitsune tsuki.","A kūko who had been living in Kyōto for a long time decided to make a journey to Edo. Along the way, he stopped to rest at the house of a samurai named Nagasaki Genjirō. He decided to “borrow” the body of one of Genjirō’s servants—a fourteen year old boy. He spoke through the boy and described to Genjirō the different ranks of kitsune and the differences between zenko and yako—good and bad kitsune. He explained that while yako harm humans, zenko possess stubborn or foolish humans in order to teach them important lessons, and they only use their magic to help people. He explained that he was in fact a zenko, merely inhabiting the boy’s body temporarily.
The kūko remained in control of Genjirō’s servant’s body for five days. During this time, he entertained Genjirō’s household and neighbors with tales of the Genpei War, the Battle of Dannoura, and the Battle of Sekigahara. After everyone had been thoroughly entertained, the kūko departed the servant’s body—but not before he used his magic to cure the diseases and ailments the boy had been suffering from.
Before he left, as a gesture of thanks for Genjirō’s hospitality, the kūko left presented Genjirō with a signed calligraphic scroll containing the secret inner teachings of Hakke Shinto.",,A late Edo Period book called Kyūsensha manpitsu tells the story of an encounter with a kūko.,,

In their absence, Namie approached Okise and threatened to murder the boy Mayotarō if she did not sleep with him. With nobody to protect her, she agreed. Gradually, she came to return Namie’s affection. Their affair continued for some time, but Namie knew it would end when Shigenobu came home. So he devised a plan to ensure that his master would never return.
Namie visited Shigenobu under the pretense of seeing his progress. Shigenobu was nearly finished, with only the arm of the female dragon left to paint. That evening, Namie coerced Shōsuke into helping him assassinate Shigenobu. Shōsuke returned to the temple and invited Shigenobu out to watch the fireflies with him. While enjoying the nighttime spectacle, Shōsuke got Shigenobu very drunk. Then, on the way back to the temple, Namie attacked and slew the drunk old samurai.
Shōsuke rushed to the temple to report that brigands had attacked his master. However, when he arrived, he saw that Shigenobu was there! The painter had just finished the female dragon’s arm, and was signing his name to the painting. When Shigenobu turned to look at him, Shōsuke was so shocked that he fainted. When he came to, Shigenobu was gone… Had it been a ghost?
Not long after that, Namie and the widow Okise were married. Shōsuke remained in Namie’s service. Namie and Okise had a baby. However, Namie did not like raising Shigenobu’s son in addition to his own. He ordered Shōsuke to murder Mayotarō.
Shōsuke took the boy to a waterfall and flung him off into the abyss. Peering down into the waterfall’s basin, he was shocked to the core. The ghost of his murdered master Shigenobu was there! It had caught the baby boy, and was cradling him safely. Shigenobu’s ghost approached Shōsuke and commanded him to take Mayotarō to the nearby temple of Shōgetsuin. Shōsuke was so shocked that he reformed his ways and did as he was commanded. Mayotarō was brought to Shōgetsuin, where Shōsuke raised him. There was a miraculous hackberry tree with bulbs on it shaped like breasts on the temple grounds. The tree produced a milk that was sweet and nourishing, and allowed Mayotarō to grow up strong and healthy.
Okise became haunted by visions of Shigenobu’s ghost. She developed painful tumors in her breasts, and was unable to produce milk for her and Namie’s newborn. The baby became sickly and died. Not long after that, Okise herself went mad and died in agony.

Therefore, shinchū play an important role in protecting humans from evil spirits who might try to interfere in their spiritual development.
Shinchū’s roots lie in ancient Chinese and Indian religion. They are related to the wrathful deities of Hinduism and Buddhism. The most well known depiction of a shinchū is in a set of five paintings depicting wrathful deities exterminating evil spirits.

Most kiko are white-furred foxes (byakko), black (kokuko), gold (kinko), and silver-furred (ginko) kiko also exist. They are spiritual beings without true physical bodies, and can take many different forms. Occasionally they appear in human form (usually beautiful women).","When a kitsune gains the rank of kiko, it sheds its body and begins to live a spiritual existence.

She is revered across Japan as a goddess of food and grain, foxes, and good fortune who is willing to grant any wish. She serves Benzaiten, the goddess of wisdom, and Daikokuten, the god of grain. In Shintō-Buddhist syncretism she is associated with the kami Inari. She is the Japanese version of the dakini from Indian cosmology.",,"Dakini was an important goddess to the nobility and samurai classes during the Middle Ages. Both the shōgun and the emperor venerated and prayed to Dakini, believing that failure to do so would bring an end to their rule. Secret rituals relating to Dakini worship were passed down orally through the imperial household. These became an integral part of the emperor’s enthronement ceremony.","Dakini worship involved secret techniques to invoke her black magic. Knowledge of the deepest secrets of her esoteric worship was believed to grant unlimited power. The ability to trap a kitsune and force it to perform kitsunetsuki was among the powers that Dakini bestowed upon her worshipers.
In China, the dakini came to be associated with jackals (possibly due to the fact that both dakini and jackals fed on carrion). Jackals did not exist in China, but the creature was described as a clever, wicked, magical beast who feeds on humans and looks like a dog. That description perfectly fit with Chinese folklore about foxes, who disguise themselves as beautiful women and feed on human life force. Jackals did not exist in Japan either, and so the word for jackals—yakan—was considered to be synonymous with foxes in Japan. Thus, the Japanese interpretation of dakini became associated with foxes.
By the time Buddhism had been transmitted from India, through China, to Japan, the dakini had been fused with various Buddhist, Shintō, onmyōdō, and folkloric concepts. In Japan, they changed from a race of demonic spirits into a single goddess resembling both a yasha and tennyo.
As a result of her long and complicated history, and the esoteric nature of her religious practice, Dakini is known by many different names, such as Shinko’ō (“Dragon Fox Queen”), Kiko Tennō (“Noble Fox Empress”), and many more due to her syncretism with Inari.","In Buddhist cosmology, the dakini were originally a race of wrathful sky-dwelling demons who served Kali and feasted upon the flesh of humans. They were energetic, wise, and muse-like spirits. They looked like beautiful nude women, carried fearsome swords for cutting out hearts, and drank blood from cups made of skulls. The dakini listened to the Buddha’s teachings and converted to Buddhism. Although they required human meat in order to survive, as part of their submission to Buddism, they promised to feast only upon the meat of the recently dead. In order to ensure that they would not starve, the dakini were granted the power to see six months into the future. This way they could wait near the people who were going to die soon and feast upon their flesh before other carrion-eating demons arrived.","Genpei seisuiki, an extended narrative of the Tale of the Heike describes an encounter with a servant of Dakini. Long ago, and impoverished young samurai named Taira no Kiyomori went hunting and shot a fox. He thought he had killed it, but to his surprise the fox suddenly transformed into a beautiful woman. She explained that she was a servant of Dakini. She promised that if Kiyomori spared her life, she would see to it that all of his wishes would come true. Kiyomori let her go free, and began to pray to Dakini. True to the fox’s word, not long after that Kiyomori’s luck began to change. His family rose to prominence, and he became wealthy and powerful.

A fudakaeshi’s goal is to remove these protections so that it and other yōkai can pass freely.","Being spirits themselves, fudagaeshi cannot touch fuda to remove them.

Once an ashirei begins to use magic, it becomes more dangerous—often seeking revenge against humans who wronged it or its friends.","Translation: “Azi” spirit
Around age fifty, all kitsune begin their ascetic training to develop their wizardry. They begin to study ancient occult practices worshiping the sun, moon, and stars. Most notably, they develop shape shifting abilities. This is accomplished by facing the Big Dipper and placing a human skull on their head. Other objects may be incorporated into this spell to flesh out the disguise. For example, a kitsune who wishes to disguise itself as a cook might also place cookware on its body. To transform into one of their favorite disguises—a beautiful young woman—a kitsune will place duckweed, a lily pad, or other leaves on its head, transforming them into long, elegant hair.
By the time an ashirei has reached one hundred years old, it has honed its magical skills enough to be promoted to the next rank: chiko.
Azi’s name, which is pronounced Ashi in Japanese, became synonymous for a beautiful and honeymouthed temptress with a wicked heart and a cruel lust for torturing men. Her legend became a pattern for future kitsune stories.","Kitsune lore is rooted in ancient superstitions which developed over many centuries in China before arriving in Japan.

For this reason, the spirits trapped in hell eagerly await the deaths of the living. Who gets reincarnated is determined by the circumstances in which a person dies. If nobody dies in the same manner, a ghost may have to wait a long time before it can leave the underworld. Itsuki are one such type of ghost.","Itsuki grow weary of waiting for people to hang themselves and take their place in hell. So they take matters into their own hands. They haunt the living to drive them to suicide, and take their place in hell. They lurk in the shadows and call out to people when they are alone, commanding them to kill themselves. The impulse which an itsuki implants in its victim is so overpowering that even a happy person with no troubles or worries whatsoever finds themself overcome with the desire to die.","Afamous story comes from Kōjimachi, in old Edo. One evening a rich man held a banquet at his estate. His friend who was supposed to help out with the banquet did not show up. The man waited, and eventually his friend finally appeared, much later than expected. “I’m sorry, but something came up. I just stopped by to tell you I can’t make it tonight.” He turned to leave, but the man stopped him and demanded to know what was so important that he couldn’t help out. “I promised to hang myself from Kuichigai gate,” he replied, and once again turned to leave. The banquet guests thought that the friend had gone mad. They refused to let him leave. Despite his struggles, they held him back, and forced him to drink with them. Eventually, he calmed down and stopped resisting.
Late into the night, a messenger arrived with news that a man had just hanged himself at Kuichigai gate. The guests were shocked. The host became convinced that an itsuki had possessed his friend. The ghost must have grown tired of waiting for him to return from the party, and convinced a different man to kill himself instead.
He demanded that his friend explain what happened before he arrived. His friend confessed that the night was like a dream, and he could not remember much. He had made his way to Kuichigai gate. A stranger approached him. He heard a voice say: “Hang yourself here and die!” He was unable to resist, but he explained to the stranger that he had a prior engagement. He begged the voice to let him excuse himself from the banquet first. It told him to do so, then quickly return and kill himself. For some reason, he could not refuse. He promised to do as he was commanded, and then came to the party.
The host’s suspicion was confirmed. He asked his friend if he still wished to kill himself. His friend looked off into the distance and shook with fear. He mimed the motion of wrapping a rope around his own neck and mumbled, “How scary! How scary!”","Itsuki is a very old superstition, with origins stretching all the way back to the folklore of ancient China. The belief that evil spirits call out to the living to coerce them into suicide remains popular in Japan even today. Urban legends describe people receiving a message from a friend joking that they’re going to go hang themself—only to find out a day later that they actually did it. Suicide notes occasionally mention that the victim heard a ghost calling out to them, telling them to do it. Friends and loved ones lament that there were no warning signs or indications at all that the person was suicidal. And stories about strings of suicides sometimes appear in the news, where one person after another kills themself in a similar manner, with seemingly no connection to the other victims. Such stories are often attributed to evil spirits like itsuki.","Most itsuki stories follow a similar pattern. A young traveler stopped at an inn overnight. That night, he heard the voice of a young woman muttering something in the adjoining room. Peeking into the room, the traveler saw a woman holding a noose and wrapping it around her neck.

They are shy and jumpy, so they prefer storerooms which remain closed during the day and are only rarely opened.","Nando babā are not violent and don’t do anything particularly harmful to humans. When someone opens the storeroom door, they quickly scurry away and hide, and so they are rarely encountered.

If you strike them on the head with a broom, they will become disoriented. Then they will run away and hide under the floorboards.","In some areas, nando babā are believed to steal newborn infants. However, this is due to confusion between nando babā and the much more dangerous yama uba.","Nando babā were probably once protector spirits, a kind of house god which inhabited storerooms.

They look like ordinary rats, only they are as large as cats or even medium-sized dogs.","In addition to growing larger and stronger than regular rats and mice, kyūso begin to exhibit peculiar behaviors. Aware of their own size and strength, they no longer scurry away at the first sign of danger. Instead of being chased by cats, they sometimes hunt them down and eat them, reversing their historical relationship.","Even more disturbing than their strange relationship with cats, kyūso are said to occasionally sneak into homes at night and have sexual relations with young women.","Despite their ferocity, kyūso are not entirely monstrous. There are a number of folktales and even modern urban legends about kyūso playing with cats, or even raising litters of abandoned kittens as if they were their own children.
In Nagoya in the 1750’s, a family was perplexed as to why their lamps were extinguishing themselves every night. Finally they discovered the cause: every night a gigantic rat would appear and lick up all of the oil from each of the house’s lanterns. In order to stop the rat, the family bought a cat. They waited until nightfall and released the cat near where they saw the kyūso. Sure enough, it appeared. The cat leaped upon the kyūso, but the rat was stronger. It tore open the cat’s throat and escaped.
The family was shocked. They searched all around town until they found a big cat who was very skilled at catching rats. They purchased the cat, and once again released it into the house. That night, when the kyūso appeared, the two creatures locked eyes and began to snarl at one another. Finally, the kyūso couldn’t hold back any more. It leaped at the cat, and tore its throat open just as it had done so before.
A folktale from Kagawa Prefecture describes one instance where a kyūso finally loses to a cat. The cat was a stray taken in by a priest named Ingen from Ōtaki Temple. A huge rat weighing over 26 kilograms was living in the temple’s main building, and had been terrorizing the priests for years. The cat was too small to kill the kyūso by itself. However, after three years of living there, the cat’s tail split in two and it became a cunning nekomata. Out of thanks for Ingen’s kind treatment, the nekomata enlisted an army of local cats to drive the kyūso out of the temple. After a long and bloody battle, the cats were finally able to kill the kyūso.","Kyūso is famously depicted in the Ehon hyakumonogatari and a number of other Edo Period sources, however stories about giant yōkai rats have been a part of Japanese and Chinese folklore since ancient times. Its name is likely a pun. There is an old saying: “kyūso neko wo kamu” (“a cornered rat will bite a cat”). Kyūso (“cornered rat”) and kyūso (“old rat”) are homophones, and it’s possible that this yōkai was invented based on this wordplay.","A tale from 15th century Dewa Province is recorded in Ehon hyakumonogatari. It tells of a kyūso which had taken up residence in a family’s barn. The family also kept a female cat. She and the kyūso came to be very good friends. One day, the cat became pregnant. She bore a litter of five kittens, but tragically died shortly after giving birth. In her place, the kyūso visited the kittens every night and took care of them. When they had all grown into adult cats, the kyūso vanished from the barn, never to return.",,

Worse, they invite the wrath of the mountain gods. They might get injured or even meet with disaster, such as being buried in an avalanche.
Some Matagi believe that kodama nezumi are the reincarnated souls of hunters and foresters who defied the wrath of the mountain gods.
The woman continued wandering until she came upon another hut. Once again begged the hunters inside to give her shelter for the night. These hunters also knew the law, but they took pity on the woman. It was too dangerous to roam the mountains at night, so they allowed her stay.
When morning came, the woman had vanished. The hunters who allowed her to stay had a successful hunt. Nobody was injured, and they all returned to their village laden with rich game. In fact, the woman was actually a mountain goddess, and she had blessed their hunt.

She transformed every one of them into kodama nezumi, and they were never seen again.","Kodama nezumi are attested to by the Matagi, an ethnic group of hunters who live in the mountains of northeastern Japan.

The only thing he is missing is a clean soul. It is said that an oni’s residence is the human heart. Their horns are the manifestation of the three poisons of Buddhism which are the root of all evil: delusion, attachment, and hatred. The more we express our ego, use things for our benefit, see things through our own eyes, and act in our own self interest, the more our horns grow. The oni in monk’s garb is similar in meaning to a wolf in sheep’s clothing. The painting is a satire of monks and priests who dress and act pious, but who actually behave in a manner more fitting an oni than a buddha. This kind of comical depiction of religious hypocrisy is a theme frequently found in yōkai art.
There is a hidden message in oni no kannebutsu. One of the oni’s horns is broken. In other words, this oni may be trying to break out of its self-delusion. The broken horn shows that it has succeeded to some degree, serving as a role model and a reminder for viewers to do the same. So on one level, the image is a caricature of religious hypocrisy, but on another level, it can be seen as a reminder of the path to salvation.","Ōtsu was a major station on both the Tōkaidō and Nakasendō roads connecting Edo with the rest of the country.

In the play Tenshu monogatari, Kame hime is depicted visiting her older sister at Himeji Castle and bringing a severed man’s head as a souvenir.
One day in December, Horibe Shuzen noticed a child who he had never seen before running about the castle. The child turned to Shuzen and said, “Hey you! You have not introduced yourself to the ruler of this castle yet. My lord is receiving visitors today, so hurry up and prepare to pay your respects!”
Shuzen was flabbergasted. “Why you…! Katō Akinari is the only lord of this castle, and I, Horibe Shizen, am his chamberlain! How dare you!”
The child just laughed at him. “So you haven’t heard of Osakabe hime of Himeji and Kame hime of Inawashiro? Then you are already doomed!” Upon saying this, the child vanished.
There was no sign of the child for some time. However, on New Year’s morning, Shuzen joined the other retainers in the castle’s hall only to see that a coffin and funerary tools had been placed before his seat at the table. He demanded to know who had put them there, but none of the other retainers had any idea.
That night, Shuzen was haunted by the sound of many people pounding mochi echoing throughout the castle.
Not long after that, Shuzen collapsed in the castle’s toilet. Two days later he was dead.
Later that summer, a seven shaku (2.1 meters) tall ōnyūdō was sighted collecting water near the rice fields surrounding the castle.

His hair grew out into spikes. His eyes began to glow like the stars. His mouth split open from ear to ear revealing a row of razor sharp fangs! The samurai was so frightened that he fainted right there in the road.
Some time later, he woke up. The monster was nowhere to be seen. The samurai ran as fast as he could down the road and stopped at the first house he saw. A woman lived there, and when she saw the terror in the poor samurai’s eyes she invited him in. As his nerves settled, he found the courage to tell the woman about the horrible monster he encountered.
“You poor thing. What a horrible sight to see alone on the road,” the woman consoled him. “By the way, did the monster you saw look something like this…?” As she spoke, her face transformed into the shunobon he had seen earlier.

She welcomed the two men into the hovel, and did her best to make them comfortable. She put some dried leaves into the hearth to start a fire, and boiled water to make tea.

One of the travelers awoke from his slumber with a funny feeling. Squinting in the darkness, he thought he saw the old woman leaning over his traveling partner and licking his face with an impossibly long tongue. The man was startled and coughed, and suddenly the old woman moved back to the hearth and nonchalantly continued spinning ramie.

During periods of famine or economic trouble, family members who were seen as a burden—such as the very old or infirm—were occasionally neglected and allowed to die in order to reduce the number of mouths to feed.

They haunt a single person or a household for a short time. Once their victims have been infected, they move on to a new target.","People have invented many ways to protect themselves from yakubyō gami. Images of protective spirits—such as amabie, baku, hakutaku, hōnengame, jinja hime, kotobuki, Shōki, and so on—were often hung in houses with the belief that they would ward off yakubyō gami. Buddhist and Shinto talismans—omamori and ofuda—were also used in this way. Holy ropes called shimenawa were strung around trees at the borders of villages to prevent evil spirits from entering.","Many kinds of yakubyō gami exist—for example, amazake babā, bake kujira, kaze no kami, keukegen, korōri, momonjii, and yonaki babā, to name a few.
In eastern Japan, on the eighth night of the second and twelfth months in the old lunisolar calendar, two yōkai—hitotsume kozō and mikari baba—would travel from house to house to record people’s misdeeds. Their report would be given to a yakubyō gami who would then come down to each village and apportion misfortune and sickness based on the report. One-eyed yōkai like hitotsume kozō were said to fear objects with many “eyes”—such as sieves and baskets—and so these were hung outside of homes on these nights to scare them away and prevent them from reporting anything to the yakubyō gami.
People have also tried to discourage appease yakubyō gami by honoring them as gods. Offerings of food were regularly performed by priests and government officials in an effort to prevent epidemics. Many of today’s popular festivals and celebrations have their roots in rituals designed to appease yakubyō gami.","Yakubyō gami are historically among the most feared yōkai of all. They frequently appeared in folklore and art during the second half of the 19th century when several epidemics struck Japan. However, the belief that sickness and misfortune are caused by invisible spirits has always been a central part of Japanese folklore. Before germ theory revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases, people had no knowledge of microorganisms that cause disease. The way sickness spread from person to person must have seemed very much like an invisible spirit was traveling from house to house and infecting people.","In 1820 in Edo, a samurai managed to capture a yakubyō gami as it was trying to enter his house. In exchange for its freedom, the spirit promised to spare everyone in the samurai’s family from sickness and misfortune.

Various combinations of kanji have been used to write those sounds. One spelling used the kanji for tiger (虎 ko), wolf (狼 rō), and tanuki (狸 ri). This spelling elicited a new creature combining the shapes of those three animals. An 1877 article the popular newspaper Kanayomi printed an illustration and description of the new beast. The story contained a disclaimer that korōri was not a real animal, but an imaginary representation of how fearsome the disease was. In other words, korōri’s real identity is the fear of cholera, rather than the disease itself.","During the late Edo and early Meiji Periods a number of cholera outbreaks struck Japan. These epidemics killed hundreds of thousand of people, and created an atmosphere of fear and unease. Because of the microbes responsible for cholera are invisible to the naked eye, most people believed that cholera was the work of yōkai. It was sometimes blamed on kitsunetsuki—fox possession—performed by a type of kitsune called an osaki. Eventually it was said to be the world of a brand new yōkai which had never been seen before.","There were a number of korōri sightings during the 1862 cholera outbreak in Edo.

In many places they were even enshrined as gods in order to avoid provoking their wrath.
While advancements in medicine eventually ended the belief in wind spirits as carriers of disease, the superstition is preserved in the Japanese word for the common cold—kaze—which translates to “evil wind.” Similarly, the phrase kaze ni au—”to encounter the wind”—means to have bad luck or to suddenly fall sick.","The yellow breath which kaze no kami exhale may be a representation of the yellow dust which falls upon Japan, especially in the early spring. Wind erosion of northern China’s Huangtu Plateau stirs large amounts of silt up into the atmosphere. The silt then falls down upon Japan and other East Asian countries in the form of yellow dust.

They look and apelike, with protruding mouths, large round eyes, and big ears. Their bodies are covered in thick, long hair. They are usually said to have three legs, although some sightings of four-legged amabiko have been reported.","Very little is known about amabiko, as they have only appeared a few times in history, and only briefly. They live in the seas around Japan, and have been spotted in Kyūshū as well as along the Sea of Japan coast. All amabiko sightings follow the same pattern: an amabiko emerges from the sea and delivers a prophecy. It foretells a period of bountiful harvest, followed by a period of disaster and disease. It instructs people to copy its image to use as protection against disease. Then it disappears.",,"Other famous soothsaying yōkai include amabie, hakutaku, hōnengame, jinja hime, and kudan. Of these, amabie’s story and physical description are so similar to amabiko’s that it has been suggested that they may actually be the same yōkai. Amabie may have been created as a result of confusing between the characters コ (ko) and エ (e), which look similar in handwritten script.
Amabiko’s name has been written using a number of different kanji combinations, so the meaning varies from place to place. 尼彦 (nun boy) 天彦 (heavenly boy) 海彦 (sea boy) and 天日子 (sunlight child) have all been used to write its name. However, amabiko is usually written phonetically rather than with kanji, so the meaning of its name remains vague.","During the latter half of the 19th century, Japan experienced a number of severe epidemics. It was believed that evil spirits were responsible for spreading disease, and that an effective way to keep them away was to display pictures of powerful good spirits. During this time there were a large number of sightings of prophetic savior yōkai, all of whom fall into the same pattern as amabiko. These yōkai appear briefly, present a prophecy, and then vanish.

But no matter how much food he was given, it was never enough to satisfy him. He was always hungry. His hunger was so great that be began to wonder what humans tasted like. Eventually, he gave in to his curiosity. He began to catch and eat people, and as a result transformed into a yōkai. From then on, whenever strangers would encounter Tarō on the streets, they would run away from him in fear.","Bekatarō appears in a number of yōkai pictures scrolls under a number of different names. It appears as an illustration with a name only, so nothing is known about what it does or where it comes from.

They are revered as patron spirits of music and medicine, and as holy guardians who protect children from sickness and danger.","Kendatsuba feed only on pleasant smells, such as incense trees and fragrant herbs. They serve other gods as singers, musicians, and messengers. Although they are artistic spirits, kendatsuba can also be violent. They often serve yasha as fearsome warriors.","Long ago, kendatsuba were among the many nature spirits who were seen as an impediment to spiritual enlightenment. This was because they would disturb monks meditating in the forests and mountains. However, they converted to Buddhism after hearing the Buddha’s sermon, and pledged to no longer bother humans. They joined the hachibushū—eight races of divine beings who serve as warriors and spiritual guardians. They became defenders of the Buddhist faith, using their music to guide humans on their spiritual paths.","The most famous depiction of a kendatsuba in Japanese art is found in the Hekijae (“The Extermination of Evil”) paintings, a National Treasure of Japan which depicts wrathful deities destroying evil spirits. In one of the paintings, Sendan Kendatsuba, king of the kendatsuba, is shown decapitating hordes of demons with his trident.","Kendatsuba come from Hindu mythology, where they are known as gandharva. Gandharva are spirits of the trees and flowers who are renowned for their skills in horsemanship, music, and illusion. They are the male counterparts and husbands of the apsaras (who are known as tennyo in Japan). They are also the keepers of a sacred hallucinogenic drink called soma. In Buddhism, they are viewed as celestial musicians, servants of the gods, and protectors of the teachings of Buddhism.

https://yokai.com/ten/,Ten,天,てん,"deva, celestial, god","tenbu, tennin, tenshu","Tendō, the realm of heaven in Buddhist cosmology","not required, but some of them do eat and drink for pleasure","Ten are a race of celestial beings in Buddhist cosmology. They inhabit Tendō, the highest of the six realms of existence in Buddhist cosmology. They are the most powerful celestial beings in existence, and rank below only the buddhas and bodhisattvas in Buddhist hierarchy. Many ten are revered as gods in Japan.","Ten are superior to humans in every way. They are stronger, longer lived, and in general much happier than humans. They can fly, they don’t require food (although some choose to eat and drink). They live in societies, and lead lives that are similar to human lives, just on a much larger scale and with far greater passions.","Ten are invisible to humans, except to those who have focused their mind so much that they are able to see all things as they truly are. Such people are said to have tengen–the heavenly eye. Such enlightened people can see beings from other planes, like ten, and hear their voices.","In general, ten resemble humans in appearance. They are often depicted with brightly colored skin, fearsome expressions, and gargantuan in size. Many ten have multiple forms, incorporating them have animalian body parts, or multiple heads and limbs. They often emit light from their bodies, and are capable of great magical feats. Ten are usually depicted wearing flowing robes or decorative armor and weapons. Specific ten are often identifiable in artwork using unique iconography, such as the animals they ride or the objects that they carry.
In a general sense, the term ten can refer to any of the inhabitants of Tendō. Sometimes all celestial beings in general–including the ashura, who do not dwell in Tendō–are included in this term. Other times, ten refers only to specific celestial beings–such as those who are worshiped as gods–while excluding the less powerful inhabitants of heaven.
Despite their godlike existence, ten–like humans–eventually grow old, die, and are reincarnated. Their state of extreme bliss and power inevitably gives way to suffering. In some ways, the great passions they experience can serve as a distraction to enlightenment. They are susceptible to corruption and temptation by evil spirits. They can be overcome with feelings of pride or jealousy. As a result, after they die they might be reborn into a much worse state of existence. In this way, ten are still considered inferior to the buddhas and bodhisattvas, who have broken free from the cycle of rebirth.
Among the ten that are the most well known in Japan are the shichifukujin (“seven lucky gods”)–Ebisu, Daikokuten, Bishamonten, Benzaiten, Fukurokuju, Jurojin, Hotei–and the shitennō (“four heavenly kings”)–Jikokuten, Zōchōten, Kōmokuten, Tamonten.","The Japanese word ten is analogous to the Sanskrit word deva, and the Buddhist devas all have Japanese counterparts in the ten. Part of the reason for Buddhism’s widespread popularity across East Asia can be attributed to its tendency to absorb local religions and customs and reinterpret them in Buddhist terms. In Buddhist mythology, the devas were originally worshipped as gods in India, but were so impressed with the Buddha’s power and compassion that they swore allegiance to Buddha as protectors of the faith. Thus, the gods of Hinduism were adapted into Buddhism early on. When Buddhism entered China, it syncretized with Chinese folk religion, and Chinese gods were interpreted as versions of the same beings found in Indian religions. Similarly, when Buddhism came to Japan, many Shintō kami were interpreted as local manifestations of buddhas and devas.",,,

Some have theorized that they haunt people and cause them to whinge and gripe incessantly about things. Another theory is that that since hair stands up on end as a result of fear, this yōkai may be a spirit of either fear or cowardice.",,,"Minokedachi appears in a number of old yōkai picture scrolls, such as the Matsui Bunko Hyakki yagyo emaki, and Bakemono zukushi emaki.

Regularly looking at a picture of a yogen no tori is said to protect the viewer from harm.","According to his report, a yogen no tori was sighted in December of 1857 near Mount Haku in Kaga Province (present-day Ishikawa Prefecture). The bird foretold, “Around August or September of next year, a disaster will occur, killing 90% of the world’s population. Those who gaze upon my image morning and night and believe in me will be spared from this suffering.”
Kizaemon believed the yogen no tori to be a messenger from the gods. He declared it to be a symbol of the great power of Kumano Gongen. An illustration of the bird was printed alongside the report so people could see it and receive its protective powers.","The story of the yogen no tori follows an Edo Period pattern of yokai warning about outbreaks and offering their image as protection. Contagious diseases like cholera are spread by invisible means, and for a long time there were no known cures or methods of protection against them. Amulets, talismans, and image of holy yōkai might not have done much to actually prevent sickness, but the willingness of people to cling to their promise of salvation is understandable.","A serious cholera outbreak struck Japan in the summer of 1858.

They often wear dilapidated old straw hats and coats, and carry a flaming torch in their mouths. They appear in the winter and creep into villages to steal raincoats, winnowing baskets and eyes from people.","Like many one-eyed yōkai, mikari baba are afraid of objects that have many holes in them. This includes things like bamboo sieves and woven cages. It is thought that the holes resemble many eyes, so the mikari baba with its single eye is afraid of them.","Mikari baba go from house to house like beggars, asking to borrow a coat, or a winnowing basket, or even just a few grains of rice. They are so greedy that they will scour gardens for every single last grain of rice. In doing so they put their faces so close to the ground that the torch they carry in their mouth can ignite fires. They will even try to “borrow” an eye from a person’s head.","Mikari baba are one of the few yōkai which are known to work together with other yōkai. They often appear together with the small one-eyed yōkai hitotsume kozō. The two of them travel from house to house during the winter, writing the names of families in a ledger which they present to the gods a few weeks later. The gods then use this report to mete out sickness and misfortune to people as they see fit.
In Chiba, Kanagawa, Tōkyō and other places where mikari baba are said to appear, villagers stay at home and remain quiet on these days. Loud voices, lighting lamps, hairdressing, and bathing are avoided. Leaving the house after dark and entering the mountains are forbidden. Measures are taken to discourage mikari baba from approaching the house. Bamboo baskets, sieves, and other woven objects with many “eyes” in them are hung outside of houses or placed on tall bamboo poles throughout villages in order to scare mikari baba away. Fallen grains of rice on the floor and in the gardens are gathered and made into a dango, which is then placed in the doorway to show that there is no rice left to pick up. If even a single grain of rice is left on the ground, it will attract a greedy mikari baba.
Mikari baba only appear on fixed dates during the year. The dates vary from tradition to tradition, but usually fall on the eighth day of the second or twelfth month of the lunisolar calendar. These dates are rooted in ancient religious practices surrounding new year rituals, and are referred to as kotoyōka–”eighth day events”–although most places have their own name for these special dates.","While the kanji in mikari baba’s name literally mean “winnowing basket borrowing hag,” this is likely a folk etymology that was invented long after she was named. The word mikari has an older meaning, referring to a period of fasting or purification before ancient religious ceremonies. It was believed that bakemono were more likely to appear before religious festivals. People stayed at home and refrained from work and normal activities prior to festivals. This period of quiet isolation was called mikari or mikawari (“changing one’s self”), referring to the interruption of regular daily life in preparation for religious festivities. Because it was forbidden for people to be outside during the mikari period, any person coming to your house was sure to be a yōkai. Mikari baba was the name given to one of these yōkai, and the kanji for her name were added later to reflect her behavior.",,,

They appear in many forms, but are often depicted as small, savage demons.","Hōsōgami travel from town to town, infecting entire communities of people with smallpox. They have fearsome tempers, which are reflected in the ferocity and virulence of smallpox. They are afraid of dogs, and they hate the color red. This is because the color red was considered to be a symbol of good health, and a red rash covering the body was a good sign of recovery from smallpox.","In houses where smallpox infections appeared, family members erected smallpox shrines and begged the hōsōgami to spare their loved ones. Although hōsōgami were feared and considered to be evil gods, it was believed that–like other yakubyō gami–they could be appeased with rituals and offerings. Red woodblock prints called akae were hung around the house to scare them off. All sorts of objects were believed to have protective powers, such as red-papered priest staves and red clothing. Other talismans included dolls and toys in the shape of dogs, owls, sea breams, cows, and the red-haired yōkai shōjō. Images of Daruma, Shōki, and Kintarō were also popular charms.","Some gods were seen as particularly effective against smallpox. Shrines to the warrior Minamoto no Tametomo were thought to be effective at keeping hōsōgami away. When Minamoto no Tametomo fled to Hachijōjima during the Hōgen Rebellion, smallpox ravaged every part of the country except for Hachijōhima. It was believed that he drove the sickness from those islands. The Shintō god of healing Sukunabikona was also a popular target of worship for those afflicted with smallpox.
Because smallpox affects entire communities rather than just individuals, a number of community rituals called hōsōgami okuri (“sending off the hōsōgami”) were developed in response to outbreaks. Bands of people playing drums, flutes, and bells would parade around the streets performing songs and dances to ward off the sickness. Small wayshrines and stone pagodas were erected at the outskirts of villages to keep them from entering.
In some areas, hōsōgami were not viewed as the cause of smallpox but as the saviors of people from the disease. In such cases, smallpox was seen as a physical manifestation of the evil inside of the human body. The infected would pray to hōsōgami for protection and salvation. Survivors of the disease would offer thanks to the hōsōgami for saving them.
Not all outbreaks of smallpox were caused by hōsōgami. Dazaifu is also famous for being the home of the exiled scholar Sugawara no Michizane. After Michizane’s death, an outbreak of smallpox and the deaths of a number of his rivals, including the emperor, were blamed on his restless spirit. It was believed that Michizane had become a tatarigami–a curse-spreading god. His curse ended when his titles were posthumously restored and he was enshrined as the kami Tenjin.
The young girl he had given a ride to must have been a hōsōgami using the rickshaw system to find her next victim!","Smallpox is believed to have made its first appearance in Japan in the Nara Period, a time of great exchange with continental Asia. The first recorded smallpox epidemic in Japan, which crossed over from the Korean peninsula to Japan in 735 CE, is described in  the Heian Period history record Shoku nihongi. Japan’s earliest outbreaks started in Dazaifu and from there spread to the rest of the country. Dazaifu was an important center of politics and international exchange, making it an ideal port of entry for smallpox.","An eyewitness account of a hōsōgami was reported in Nisshin shinjishi, a Meiji Period newspaper. A rickshaw driver in Honjo, Tōkyō reported that he gave a ride to a young girl about 14 or 15 years old. She asked him to drive her from Midorichō to Asakusa. Midway through the ride it began to grow dark, so the rickshaw driver pulled over to light a lantern. However, when he stopped, he noticed that the girl had vanished from the back of his rickshaw. In her place, there was a rice barrel lid with a red staff mounted to it. He recognized the barrel lid with the red staff as a symbol of a hōsōgami.",,
https://yokai.com/osaki/,Osaki,オサキ,おさき,varies depending on the kanji used,osaki gitsune (“osaki fox”),forests and mountains; also found in homes and human bodies,"carnivorous, but with a fondness for azuki beans mixed with rice","Osaki are small, magical mammals with fluffy tails that split at the end. They resemble weasels or mice, or very small foxes. Some accounts describe them as a cross between a fox and an owl, a little bit larger than a house mouse. Their fur is mottled and can be brown, grey, red, white, or orange. Their noses are white at the tip. Their ears look like human ears. They sometimes have a black stripe which runs from their nose to their tail.","Osaki live in the mountains, but also find their ways into human villages and homes. They are usually invisible to the human eye, but will show themselves at the sound of a pot lid or a rice container being struck. They are extremely fast, so they appear and disappear suddenly. They reproduce quickly, forming large packs and moving together as a swarm. Like other kitsune, they are famous for their magical abilities, and are often used by the gods as divine messenger animals.","Osaki are used by humans as magical familiars in the same way that other types of kitsune are. If kept happy, osaki are able to bring material wealth to their owners and ruin to their owners’ enemies. Families which control osaki are known as osaki moch or osaki tsukai. Osaki mochi families find incredible wealth and prosperity, while the fortunes of their neighbors mysteriously fall. When an osaki mochi family’s fortunes rise, they overflow with wealth. Conversely, if their fortunes fall, they fall into complete and utter ruin and never recovers.","Because of their small size, magical powers, and ability to hide on the human body, they are often confused with kudagitsune.
Osaki are found in Nagano and throughout most of the Kantō region. Within Tokyo, however, they are only found in the Okutama mountains in the far west of the prefecture. This is due to the influence of the Ōji Inari Shrine, the head shrine for kitsune in the Kantō Region, which forbade low-ranking kitsune like osaki from entering Edo.
Great care was taken to keep this status secret. Osaki mochi families were historically shunned and mistrusted for their unnatural abilities. They often withdrew from society and avoided contact with the outside world.
Osaki possession is passed down from generation to generation matrilineally. Marrying into an osaki mochi family would make the other family osaki mochi too. If a bride was discovered to be osaki mochi, the wedding would immediately be called off. Marriage was only permitted with other osaki mochi families. Once a family became osaki mochi, they would always be osaki mochi. There is no magic ritual capable of removing osaki from a family line. In a way, rather than the family possessing osaki, the osaki possess the family.
Like other kinds of kitsune, osaki are capable of entering human bodies. This power is called kitsune tsuki, and is used against people who have wronged the osaki or its human family. Victims of osaki possession are struck with bad luck and mysterious injuries. They develop fevers, mental and physical agitation, gluttonous appetites, and other eccentricities. This possession can only be cured through difficult exorcisms. Villagers are cautioned not to tease wild osaki in order to avoid invoking their curse.
The name osaki can be written with a number of kanji combinations, reflecting its diverse history. The most common writing is 尾先, meaning “tail tip.” This comes from the fact that the creatures were formed from the shattered tips of Tamamo no Mae’s nine tails. An alternate writing of its name uses the kanji 尾裂, meaning “split tail.” This refers to the fact that osaki have two tails. Yet another version uses the kanji 御先, which comes from the word misaki and refers to animal spirits employed by the gods.","Osaki are said to come from the great nine-tailed kitsune Tamamo no Mae. When she was killed, her body transformed into a great cursed stone called Sesshō seki. Its curse was ended when the priest Gennō smashed the rock into pieces, which then flew across the country. Some of the pieces of Tamamo no Mae’s tails landed in Gunma and transformed into the first osaki.",,,

Their body shape resembles a hammer or a mallet head with no handle. They range in size from thirty to eighty centimeters long. Their scaly skin is speckled in various earth tones, and they have light-colored bellies. Their viper-like fangs carry a deadly venom. Unlike snakes, tsuchinoko have eyelids. Due to their shape and color they are often said to resemble beer bottles.","Tsuchinoko are found throughout Japan. They are active during the day from spring through fall, and hibernate through the winter. They make their nests in holes along wooded riverbanks. They give off a call which sounds like “chee,” and they snore when they sleep.",,"Tsuchinoko feed on insects when they are young, and frogs and mice as they grow larger. There are occasional reports of them eating larger animals like cats or dogs. They can eat vast quantities of food for their small size. They are also quite fond of sake. They are attracted to the smell of miso, dried squid, and burning hair.
Despite their awkward shape, tsuchinoko are extremely nimble. They can move about like an inchworm, but they are best known for their habit of rolling and tumbling about. They can roll sideways like a log, or tumble vertically from tip-to-tail. They can also swallow their tail–making their body into a ring–and roll like a wheel. Tsuchinoko are great jumpers as well. By some estimates, they can jump from two to five meters.
Tsuchinoko became a national sensation during the 1970’s, when a number of sightings and supposed live captures of tsuchinoko were reported. This sparked a “tsuchinoko boom,” and people all over the country began hunting for tsuchinoko. An explosion of eyewitness accounts, blurry photographs, and talk show specials cemented tsuchinoko as a household term. Since then, it has remained an extremely popular subject among cryptozoologists, with monetary rewards occasionally offered to anyone able to produce a photograph or a physical specimen.
Tsuchinoko are known by many regional names, such as bachihebi, dotenko, inokohebi, korohebi, tatekurikaeshi, tsuchinbo, tsuchihebi, and so on. They are also sometimes considered to be identical to the yōkai nozuchi or tsuchi korobi–although others say that they are separate creatures.","Creatures resembling tsuchinoko have been part of Japanese folklore since prehistoric times.

He disguised himself as a young student, infiltrated a seminary, and studied Nichiren Buddhism for ten years until his disguise was discovered.",,,"When the other students and teachers arrived each morning, Denpachi would already be there, performing his temple chores like sweeping the floors and preparing meals. Denpachi was an exemplary student. He poured himself into his studies. He performed his ascetic training diligently, and learned to comprehend the deepest esoteric mysteries. From time to time he even instructed the other students in some of the more difficult teachings. Denpachi came to be highly respected among his fellow students and the faculty.
Though he was a diligent student, Denpachi was occasionally careless. Students and teachers discovered fox’s paw prints leading into and out of seminary buildings. Once in a while, leaves onto which Denpachi had copied the Lotus Sutra and accidentally dropped would be found in the gardens. Rumors spread that a kitsune was performing mischief at the seminary. Of course nobody suspected Denpachi.
For ten years, Denpachi continued to study diligently at Iidaka. One day, a high priest named Saint Nōke was installed as the new headmaster of Iidaka. There was a ceremony and a great banquet. Though alcohol was normally forbidden, the restriction was lifted for the evening, and it turned into a night of wild drinking. The students, including Denpachi, drank themselves into a stupor. Denpachi became so drunk that he lost control over his disguise, and transformed back into a fox.
His deception revealed, the other students descended upon Denpachi. They tied him up and beat him nearly to death, then dragged him before Saint Nōke for judgment. Denpachi kneeled before the headmaster with tears in his eyes and begged for forgiveness. He explained that his real name was Konoha, and he lived in a hole in the woods near the seminary. He had heard the young priests every day reciting their chants and performing their studies. He wanted to try studying too. So he had disguised himself as a young boy and slipped into the seminary, blending in with the crowds.
Saint Nōke listened to Konoha’s plea. He was touched by the kitsune’s sincerety, his success and diligence as a student, and his passion for helping others. He told the students, “For the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to have reached the heart of this lowly beast, it is truly a marvelous thing!” Saint Nōke forgave Konoha’s deception.
Konoha promised that from then on, he would serve the temple as a guardian spirit and protector of the faith. Saint Nōke built a small shrine for Konoha to live in, in one corner of the lecture hall’s front garden. Konoha’s spirit came to be known as Konoha Inari Daimyōjin, a popular local deity who grants wishes to farmers, merchants, and students. His shrine still stands, and remains a popular place of devotion to this day.",,"Long ago, there was a major Buddhist seminary in Iidaka.

She haunted a mountain pass called Tachimi tōge. She is most famous for disguising herself as a prostitute named Otomi and bewitching men crossing through the mountains, and for her ability to escape capture over and over. Her name Otomi jorō (Otomi the prostitute) was shortened over time into the nickname Otonjorō.",,,"Her favorite food was said to be fried rat, and if you put up a bunch of them for sale she was sure to come and try to buy one. She transformed leaves into one sen coins and used them to buy the friend rats. Sellers would try to rip the coins in half before accepting them. If it didn’t rip, it was a genuine coin. But if it ripped, it was a transformed leaf, and the person buying your fried rats was actually Otonjorō.
A number of famous kitsune come from this region. Together they are known as the Inaba Five Kitsune. In addition to Otonjorō, the other four are her husband Keizōbō, Shoroshoro kitsune, Onashi gitsune, and Onji no kitsune.
The woman called out to the merchant, “Oh merchant! Would you take me to a nearby village and help me find someone who would take me as a bride?” He decided to trick her before she could trick him. He could take her to his friend Jūbē’s house, and together they would capture her and make her suffer. He put on his best poker face and told her to come with him.
He led her to Jūbē’s house, only to discover it was already decorate in preparation to receive a bride. It was quite late at night, but Jūbē’s servants welcomed him inside, and treated him with the greatest hospitality. They offered him a nice hot bath, which sounded just wonderful to the road-weary merchant. He soaked in the hot bath for some time, and eventually the sky began to lighten as dawn approached.
The village’s farmers awoke with the dawn and headed out into the fields. They called out, “Look over there! That merchant must have been bewitched by Otonjorō! He’s washing himself in the dung pots!” The merchant suddenly found himself sitting naked in a dung tank in the middle of a field, rubbing fertilizer into his face, surrounded by laughing farmers. The whole night had been an illusion.
Another legend tells of a village headman who could no longer contain his anger at Otonjorō’s constant mischief. He called all the villagers together and promised to greatly reward anyone who would exterminate the kitsune. A pair of braggadocious young men volunteered to take her down.
The men ventured into the mountains to look for Otonjorō. Soon they reached Tachimi tōge, where they spied a fox walking along a small river up ahead of them. They watched as the creature rubbed river mud all over its body, and transformed into a young woman. Then, she picked up a river stone and transformed it into a baby, which she cradled in her arms. The two men followed her all the way to a small mountain hovel, which she entered.
Peering into the hovel, the young men saw an old man and an old woman gleefully cradling the stone baby. They burst inside and told the elderly couple that the baby was a stone, and that they had been bewitched by a kitsune. But no matter how much they explained, the old couple would not hear it. They kept insisting that the baby was their own grandchild.
The young men had enough. To prove the baby was just an illusion, they snatched it up from the elderly couple and dropped it into a boiling pot. The baby screamed, and died, and did not not turn back into rock. The young men were horrified. The elderly couple were furious. They overpowered the shocked young men and tied them up, then called for someone to fetch the town magistrate to come arrest them.
A passing priest heard them, and said that he had a better idea. They should give the two criminals to his temple, and he would ensure they spend the rest of their lives praying for the soul of the dead grandchild. The elderly couple agreed. The young men shaved their heads, and traveled into the mountains to join the priest’s temple to pray for the soul of the baby they had killed.
Some time passed, and people back in the village began to worry about the fate of the two strong young men. They sent a search party into the mountains to find them. Near Tachimi tōge, by a small river, they discovered the two young men sitting river mud. Their heads were shaved, and they were reciting the name of Buddha over and over while striking a river rock.",,"One night, a merchant was traveling through the Tachimi pass on his way to the castle.

She broke a few branches and slid them into her hair, and they turned into beautiful hairpins. She traced her fingers along the trunk of a large tree and circled around it. As she did, her clothing transformed into a fabulous white bridal kimono. “How strange… This woman must be a kitsune!” he thought to himself as he stared in amazement.
The woman approached a bamboo grove. Countless fox-shaped faces began to emerge from the forest. They were carrying long ornate chests and a palanquin, which they brought up to the bride for her to enter. Each of the guests was wearing a splendid kimono decorated with their family crests. “I was right! It’s a kitsune wedding!” The man was excited to witness something so rare.
The man followed the procession for a long time, deeper and deeper into the mountains. Finally, it arrived at a large manor with a straw roof. The kitsune all entered the manor. “This must be where the ceremony will take place!” thought the man. He searched around for a place from which he could spy on the ceremony. He found a small hole high up in the wall. The man climbed upon a large stone step and stretched his legs to reach the hole. From there he could see the whole interior. The inside of the manor was decorated with expensive dining tables. A kitsune was seated at each one, and the ceremony began. “It’s just like a human wedding!” the man thought to himself.
After watching for some time, the man grew tired and stepped down off from the peephole. He lit his pipe and had a smoke. As he puffed away on his pipe, the scenery changed before his eyes. What was a great straw-thatched manor just a moment ago was now a wooden shrine. What he thought was a stone stair was the pedestal of a great stone lantern. And the hole he peeked through was the round hole of the lantern. The guests were all gone.

He opened up his purse, but the coins the woman had paid with were gone. All that was inside was a handful of leaves. He realized that he must have been tricked by Okon gitsune.
The fisherman decided to find the kitsune and punish her. He grabbed a wooden staff and went back to the hills. The day grew late, but he could not find the kitsune anywhere. Suddenly, he heard a call from down the road. A daimyō’s procession was heading up the hill and straight his way! The soldiers at the front of the procession were ordering him to make way.
The fisherman jumped off the road and prostrated himself before the procession. He bowed his head, and the ground rumbled as soldiers, horses, and the daimyo’s palanquin passed. Suddenly, it struck him as odd that daimyō would process through this rural stretch of hills. He though that this must be Okon gitsune playing a trick on him. Now was his chance to punish her! The fisherman jumped up and approached the daimyō’s palanquin. He tried to pull open the door.
“INSOLENT PEASANT!” came a voice from the palanquin.
The daimyō’s guards seized the fisherman and forced him to the ground. The daimyō stepped out of his palanquin. He drew his sword from its sheath and raised it to cut off the fisherman’s head. The fisherman groveled and begged the daimyō to spare his life.
The daimyō’s rage subsided. “Very well. You may live, but you must shave your head to show repentance.”
Guards held the fisherman down and cut all the hair from his head. The fisherman grovelled on the side of the road until the procession left. He had his life, but everyone in the village would tease him for this. He wrapped his head in a kerchief and sheepishly returned home.

They contained detailed instructions on disease prevention, including lists of things to abstain from and medicinal foods to eat. Some important things to avoid during infection were sex, fish and shellfish, poultry, alcohol, oily foods, and pickled vegetables.

And so they decided to enlist the help of a mistress. They found a lovely, well bred girl from Kyoto, seventeen years old, named Monohana, and hired her into their household. Monohana got along well with the couple. There were no feelings of jealousy or ill will between her and Kakehashi. And soon, all three were delighted to learn that Monohana was with child.
Sadly, Uraemon was called away to Kamakura for work. He would be gone for months, and miss the birth of his first child. He left the care of his household–and his beloved goldfish–in the care of his wife and his mistress.
Next door to the Karakoto household lived a man named Furutori Sabunta. Sabunta was twenty one years old, and a man of exceptional beauty and charm. Unfortunately, he was also greedy and violent–vices which had left him deep in poverty. He was jealous of the wealth and happiness his neighbors in the Karakoto household, and so he hatched a plan.
One day while Kakehashi was chasing away a cat who had been eyeing her husband’s precious goldfish, Sabunta approached her. He warned her that Uraemon and Monohana’s affair had begun long before he hired her as a mistress, and that Uraemon and Monohana were planning to poison and murder Kakehashi. Kakehashi did not believe Sabunta, but Sabunta insisted he had proof. He told her that the postman had mistakenly delivered a message from Uraemon to his home which proved what he had said. The message was, of course, forged, but it was enough to convince Kakehashi. All of her good will towards Monohana gave way to hatred and jealousy.
Before long, Sabunta and Kakehashi had become close friends. Sabunta toyed with Kakehashi’s heart, and manipulated her into developing a plan to murder Monohana. When Monohana was eight months pregnant, they put their plan into motion. Kakehashi lured the heavily pregnant Monohana up the steep staircase to the second floor of their storehouse. There, she let loose all of her rage, hurling insult after insult at Monohana. Kakehashi stuffed a towel into Monohana’s mouth so she could not scream. Then she stripped the girl naked, bound her with rope, and strung her from the rafters. Then Kakehashi beat Monohana’s face and body mercilessly with a bamboo pole. She beat her until her face swelled up like a balloon. She beat her until her eyeballs popped from their sockets. Monohana was no longer recognizable.
Kakehashi left Monohana strung up in the storehouse for three days. Monohana could not scream with her mouth gagged. Her hair became matted to her face with tears. Her white skin was stained deep red from the rivers of blood running across her naked body. She was weak and delirious from starvation and dehydration. Her starved body contrasted with her swollen belly, causing her to look like a gaki. Finally, after three days, Monohana managed to free herself from her bonds. She crawled down the staircase and, overcome with thirst, made her way to the crystal fish tank where Uraemon’s goldfish were swimming around. Monohana dipped her head into the fishbowl to drink, and after slaking her thirst she inadvertently let out a sob.
Kakehashi and Sabunta heard Monohana’s cry. They burst into the room and furiously began to kick Monohana. They kicked her until her belly split open, and a baby boy spilled out from her body onto the floor. Filled with jealous rage, Kakehashi strangled the baby boy to death right there. This was too much for poor Monohana to handle. She screamed one last violent breath, vomiting a fountain of blood into the fish tank, and died.
As Monohana’s blood swirled around the fish tank, the water began to roil. Her blood soaked into the skin of the goldfish, and they began to mutate. Their multi-colored bodies all became deep red. Their cheeks puffed out and their eyeballs swelled, resembling Monohana’s face. Their abdomens inflated and hung from their bodies like Monohana’s pregnant belly. Their tails fanned out and split, like Monohana’s shredded skin. And they began to swim about erratically in the tank, gulping water and vomiting it out like one confused and delirious.
Suddenly afraid, Sabunta and Kakehashi grabbed the Karakoto house’s valuables and fled into the night.
When he was told what happened, Uraemon returned home to bury Monohana and pray for her soul. His beloved goldfish had mutated from Monohana’s blood, and he could no longer bear to look at them. He released them into the temple pond of Chōsenji, where they remained and multiplied–a living memorial to her suffering.","Kingyo no yūrei first appear in Edo Period novelist Santō Kyōden’s story Baika hyōretsu, in which a young woman named Monohana is murdered and her soul becomes stuck in the body of a goldfish.

The merchant let the kitsune eat and drink as much as she wanted. Eventually, drunk and full, she fell asleep on the floor. The merchant went downstairs, ordered three dishes of tamagoyaki to go, and then told the shopkeeper that the woman upstairs would cover the bill. Then he slipped out.
A server went upstairs to wake up the sleeping woman and ask her to pay. The kitsune was shocked. Her disguise failed, revealing her tail and ears. The restaurant staff were as surprised as the kitsune. They chased her all around the restaurant, beating and yelling at her. Somehow, the kitsune managed to escape, and ran back to her hole in the ground.
The owner of the restaurant came out to see what all the commotion was. When the staff told him what had happened, he scolded them. “This restaurant owes its success to the Ōji Inari Shrine. How could you beat one of its kitsune?” Together, the owner and the staff went to the shrine to apologize and ask for forgiveness.
Meanwhile, the merchant arrived at his friend’s house. As they shared the tamagoyaki, the merchant told his friend what had happened. His friend looked worried. “Kitsune are vindictive. It’s probably going to bring a curse down upon your whole family!”
The following day, the merchant returned to Ōji to make amends. Near the place where he saw the kitsune the day before, a fox cub was playing near a hole in the ground.

This creates a maelstrom as the fish’s great mass displaces huge amounts of water.,"Sailors frequently mistook surfaced akaei for islands–a mistake which was often fatal.

They found no trace of buildings or people anywhere. When they tried to slake their thirst in one of the many ponds, they discovered that every bit of water on the island was salty. Eventually, they gave up any hope of finding repairs on the island. They returned to their battered ship to seek help elsewhere.

She brutally murdered her husband’s mistress, and in turn fell victim to the curse of the mistress’ vengeful ghost, and her own karma.",,,"Kakehashi and Sabunta ran into a gang of bandits, who stripped them of all of their stolen goods. Penniless and wanted for murder, Kakehashi and Sabunta had no choice but to hide away in the mountains. They survived by becoming bandits themselves. Sabunta dressed up as a yuki onna, scaring and robbing travelers in the snowy mountain pass. He amassed a large amount of wealth, and eventually became a powerful bandit leader himself.
Meanwhile, Kakehashi was tormented by the spirit of Monohana. She suffered terrible dreams in which she was attacked by countless goldfish which bit her all over. When she woke up, she was covered in painful bruises in all of the places she dreamed the goldfish had bit her. Kakehashi put ointment on the wounds, but it only caused the pain to increase. Eventually, the pain was so great that she became bedridden.
Kakehashi’s symptoms worsened day by day. Her face began to swell. Pustules erupted all over her body. Her skin split, and became streaked with rivers of pus and blood. The pain and the itching were unbearable. The stench was nauseating. As her symptoms worsened, her cheeks inflated like balloons. Her lips and nose rotted and fell of, permanently exposing her teeth. Her inflamed eyes pushed out of their sockets.
Kakehashi could no longer swallow food, and began to starve. She could barely drink water, and even that caused her great pain. Her belly became distended like a taiko drum. Her arms and hands shriveled up until they looked like skin and bone. She now looked like a giant, grotesque goldfish. No doctors were able to diagnose her illness, but Kakehashi knew that it was the curse of Monohana’s ghost.
Consumed by suffering, Kakehashi lashed out at Sabunta. “You brought this curse upon me! You turned me into an adulteress. You made me kick Monohana’s pregnant belly until it split open. You made me kill her unborn child! Don’t think I will ever forget it!” Kakehashi’s pain caused her mind to snap. She alternated between spitting curses at Sabunta, and cuddling her pillow like a child, singing lullabies to it.
If Kakehashi wished for death, Monohana’s curse did not grant it to her. Letting Kakehashi die would be too merciful. Monohana wanted her to suffer. And so Kakehashi slowly recover from her illness. But while her pain and her insanity gradually subsided, but her physical deformities never healed. She was cursed to look like a monster for the rest of her life. After that, Sabunta returned home less and less often. Kakehashi became increasingly jealous. She was terrified that Sabunta would leave her because of her disfigurement.
One day, after Sabunta had not returned for several days, Kakehashi grew tired of waiting. She went looking for him herself. She found him drinking sake in his camp, with his arms around a pair of beautiful young women. Kakehashi was furious. She stormed over and grabbed both women by the hair and snarled at Sabunta, “Wherever you hide, don’t think I won’t find you!”
Without hesitation, Sabuta drew his sword to Kakehashi’s neck. He revealed the truth to her: “Everything I said to you was a lie. Your husband never betrayed you; I forged those letters just to manipulate you. I never loved you, I just used you to get Urazaemon’s money. You are the one who killed Monohana. How dare you begrudge me for your sins! Everything that happened to you is your fault, because you were dumb enough to believe my lies!”
Kakehashi regretted everything she had done to her husband and to Monohana, but it only fueled her rage. Her eyes flared with anger. Her fangs snapped in her lipless mouth. Her long hair flew about wildly. Gripping the two girls by their hair, she screamed. “If you kill me, I will find you. Alive or dead I will find you. I will hunt you down you across the six realms and the four directions. And I will have my revenge.” Sabunta laughed. Holding his sake in one hand and his sword in the other, he mocked Kakehashi. Then he cut Kakehashi’s head from her body.
Suddenly the sky grew dark. A gust of wind blew and the earth began to shake. Kakehashi’s severed head shot up into the sky. Her eyes burned white-hot and stared at Sabunta. Flames leapt from her mouth. The screaming head spiraled around him in circles. And then, it suddenly vanished. Sabunta looked back at Kakehashi’s body. Her dead hands were still gripping the hair of the two girls. Sabunta cut her arms from her body to free the girls, but it was two late. They were both dead.
From then on, Sabunta was haunted by Kakehashi’s vengeful ghost. Everywhere he went, Kakehashi found him and tortured him relentlessly. She inflicted him with sickness and madness, and like Kakehashi his disease left him disfigured. And just as Monohana had done to her, Kakehashi never killed Sabunta. It was Urazaemon’s brother Takijiro who eventually tracked Sabunta down and took revenge upon him.",,"Kakehashi was the beloved wife of the samurai Karakoto Urazaemon. Kakehashi was unable to become pregnant, so Urazaemon kept a mistress named Monohana. Kakehashi and Monohana got along very well. But while Urazaemon was away on business, his neighbor Furutori Sabunta plotted against him. He laid a trap for Kakehashi. Toying with her emotions, Sabunta made Kakehashi believe that Urazaemon and Monohana were planning to murder her. He showed her letters from her husband to his mistress describing their plan. Then Sabunta seduced Kakehashi. He convinced her to kidnap and torture Monohana, then finally drown her in a goldfish tank.

He was renowned for his skill at performing The Tale of the Heike–particularly his rendition of the Battle of Dan no ura and the death of the child emperor Antoku. His playing was said to be so splendid that he could even make ghosts and demons cry.",,,"Hōichi’s story may be originally based on a real life 14th century priest named Akashi Kakuichi. Kakuichi became a blind later in life and took up the biwa. He soon surpassed his own master, and he became one of the most influential biwa masters in Japan. His version of The Tale of the Heike is considered the standard to this day.
Hōichi’s temple, Amidaji in Shimonoseki is now known as Akama jingū, a shinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Antoku. Its grounds contain a small shrine dedicated to Hōichi, and a gravesite of fourteen Heike members. Every so often, there are reports of restless Heike ghosts sighted in and around the shrine grounds.
Hōichi played, and was surprised at the dramatic reaction to his performance. At the climax of the story, when he told of the defeat of the Heike and the drowning of the young emperor, every one began weeping loudly. When he was finished, they praised his skill. A voice asked him to return again the following night. Then the samurai escorted Hōichi back to his temple. The samurai commaned Hōichi to tell nobody what had happened.
The next evening, the samurai returned for Hōichi. Once again, Hōichi played, moving his audience to tears. The high priest of Amidaji noticed that Hōichi had been leaving at night and not returning until morning. When he asked Hōichi where he was going, Hōichi refused to tell. The priest was worried, and ordered his servants to follow Hōichi.
That night, the samurai once again came for Hōichi. The temple servants followed Hōichi to an old Heike family graveyard. Hōichi sat down before the grave of Emperor Antok. As he passionately played his biwa, orbs of ghostly fire flared up and danced in the air around him. The servants realized that Hōichi was in terrible danger. They dragged him away from the graves and back to the temple and told the high priest what had happened.
The high priest explained to Hōichi that nobles he had encountered were in truth vengeful ghosts who had perished at the Battle of Dan no ura. They would not be satisfied with his performance; they would kill him and take his soul. The ghosts would surely return for Hōichi the following night. The priest painted the words of the Heart Sutra all over Hōichi’s body so that the ghosts would not be able to see him. They could still hear him, so the priest warned Hōichi not to make any sound.
The samurai returned the next evening. He called out to Hōichi, but Hōichi remained silent. The ghost called out again. “Why do you not answer? I see your biwa, so I know you are there.” Hōichi heard the heavy boots and grumbling of the ghost as it searched his room. “Ah, now I see why you do not answer. Your mouth and body have been taken away. Only your ears remain! Well then, I will take the ears to my lord as proof that I did everything I could.” The ghost took hold of Hōichi’s ears and tore them right off body. Hot blood poured down the sides of Hōichi’s face and body, but he did not cry out. The ghost left, taking Hōichi’s ears with him.
In the morning, the temple servants found Hōichi lying unconscious in a pool of blood. When they saw what had happened, the high priest realized his mistake. He had painted the sutra all over Hōichi, except for on his ears. Thus Hōichi’s ears remained visible to the ghost. He apologized to Hōichi and tended to his wounds. The ghosts never returned. Hōichi was saved, his story traveled far and wide, and he grew more famous than ever. People came from all around to hear the earless biwa master whose music had the power to make ghosts cry.","Hōichi’s story is famous even outside of Japan thanks to Lafcadio Hearn’s 1904 book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. Hearn’s version was based on Isseki Sanjin’s telling of the story in Gayū kidan, published in 1782. Although this version is the most famous, there are other versions with variations in details such as location (one takes place in Tokushima, another in Nagano), the name of the main character (Dan’ichi in one version, Un’ichi in another), and so on.",One night a samurai visited Hōichi and demanded he perform for his lord. The samurai led the blind Hōichi to the place where his lord and court were gathered. It seemed that a large number of people were in attendance.

They are found in sacred freshwater lakes and ponds.,,,"As they descended the mountain, the air began to grow foggy. Around Akamatsu Pound, they could no longer see where they were headed and had to wait. A beautiful woman emerged from the mists and asked them what they were doing. When they explained their reasons to the woman, she produced a bottle of water from her robes. She told them it was holy water collected from the drew drops on the grass around Akamatsu Pond and offered to the gods of the Ōkamiyama Shrine on New Years Day. She said that if Oryō drank it, she would surely be blessed with a child. Oryō eagerly drank the water. It made her head spin as if she was drunk, but within moments she felt different. She felt that she was with child. A moment later, the fog had cleared away, and the beautiful woman was nowhere in sight.
The following year Oryō gave birth to a beautiful girl they named Ochiyo. Jinnai and Oryō loved her dearly. They told her all about how she was a blessing from the gods of Mount Daisen and Akamatsu Pond. The three of them lived happily together, and eventually Ochiyo grew into a lovely young woman.
When Ochiyo was sixteen years old, she was promised in marriage to a young man that Jinnai chose. Ochiyo did not love her intended or want to marry him, but she also did not want to betray the wish of her parents. She did not argue with her parents’ selection, but before the wedding was to occur she asked her parents to allow her to make a pilgrimage to Ōkamiyama Shrine to report her marriage to the gods who gave her life. They agreed, and sent her nanny Osuma to accompany Ochiyo on the journey to Mount Daisen.
Ochiyo wore her finest kimono, and with Osuma by her side she traveled to the summit of Mount Daisen and gave prayers to the gods. On the way down from the mountain, she crossed the same location where her parents had encountered the strange and beautiful girl who gave them the holy water. Ochiyo approached the edge of the pond and stared into it. Suddenly, a thick mist poured off of the pond’s surface and surrounded Ochiyo.
Ochiyo seemed to ponder something in the mist. She turned to Osuma, then thanked her and said goodbye. “I was born into this world as a human, but this is only a temporary form. I am actually a fish, and this pond is my real home.” She gave Osuma a letter to deliver to her parents, and then she dove into the pond. Osuma screamed and begged Ochiyo to come back. Then, a giant carp with shining, golden scales splashed around in the lake and looked up at Osuma. Its face was unmistakably the face of Ochiyo.
Osuma returned to Matsue. She told Jinnai and Oryō what had happened, and they were overcome with sadness. Osuma deliverd Ochiyo’s final letter to her parents. In it, Ochiyo thanked her parents for everything, and explained that because she was a teruto uo, she could not marry a human. Finally, she told them that if they ever wanted to see her again, all they had to do was come to the bank of Akamatsu Pond and call her name. Although it was difficult, Jinnai and Oryō accepted their daughter’s confession. They were thankful to the gods of Mount Daisen for giving them a lovely daughter. Jinnai built a shrine in honor of the teruto uo and entrusted Ochiyo’s letter to it.
Some time later, Jinnai and Oryō and their relatives traveled to Akamatsu Pond. They gathered at the water’s edge and called out, “Teruto uo!” From the depths of the pond came a thunderous roar as if in response. However, they never saw Ochiyo or the teruto uo again.
Since then, many travelers have come to Akamatsu Pond on Mount Daisen in order call out teruto uo’s name. And Jinnai’s shrine became a popular destination for couples and single people to pray to the gods for love.",A legend of a teruto uo from Izumo Province was recorded by Englishman Richard Gordan Smith during his travels through Japan.,"In 1646, a man named Ōtani Jinnai and his wife Oryō lived in Matsue, Izumo Province. Although they tried for many years, they were unable to have children. They visited many shrines and temples to beg the gods and buddhas to grant them a child. They heard that the gods of the Ōkamiyama Shrine on Mount Daisen had a miraculous effect on couples wishing to conceive, and so Jinnai and Oryō climbed Mount Daisen to ask for the gods’ favor.",,

They named her Ohatsu. She was well loved by her family and their servants. As she grew, stories of her stunning beauty traveled far and wide. Eventually she caught the eye of Lord Matsudaira Kō, who desired her for his bride. Ohatsu did not wish to be married, but there was no way a retainer like her father could turn down a lord’s request. So Ohatsu’s parents prepared to send her away to the castle. Before she left to become a bride, Ohatsu asked to visit Akamatsu Pond to give thanks to the god who granted her life. Her parents naturally agreed.
Ohatsu climbed Mount Daisen with an escort of her family’s servants and guards. They arrived at Akamatsu Pond. Its surface was like a mirror, reflecting the clear sky and verdant mountains surrounding it. Ohatsu’s servants suggested that she wash her hair in the beautiful pond; its water would surely make her hair even more beautiful for her lord. Ohatsu dipped her hair into the water and began combing it. With each stroke of the comb, her hair grew longer, as if creeping towards the water’s edge. Then Ohatsu stood up and stepped out onto pond, walking on the surface of the water. Her servants called out to her, but she did not turn back. When she reached the center of the pond, a whirlpool churned beneath her and she sank down into the depths.
The servants panicked. They called out to the pond and begged Ohatsu to come back. A whirlpool once again opened up in the center of the pond. Ohatsu reemerged from the maelstrom, but from her waist down she appeared to be a giant serpent. She spoke to her servants: “I am a serpent who lives in this pond. When Tanomo came to me and begged for a child, his wish was so sincere that I decided to become Ohatsu and live a human life for some time. But that time is over now, and I must return to my pond. Thank you, everyone, for raising me and caring for me these many years. From here on, I will give happiness and fortune to all who come to pray for me.” Then, she sank beneath the surface of the water and was never seen again.
A small stone shrine was built for Ohatsu besides the pond. She is worshiped there as the dragon god of Akamatsu Pond, and is said to grant wishes to pilgrims and protect the local villages against drought. Her festival is held every year on Mount Daisen on June 18th–the day that she returned to her serpent form.
And in the Matsuura house in Matsue City, every year on June 18th they would remember Ohatsu by raising eight folding screens around a water basin in their banquet hall. The sand found in the bottom of the water basin the next day was proof that Ohatsu had visited.",,"Long ago in Matsue, Izumo Province, lived a man named Matsuura Tanomo.

They lurk underwater in the shade of structures like bridges or watermills and wait for young men to venture close to the water. They leap out of the river and land on a bridge or a riverbank. When a young man approaches, the kawahime emerges from the water. She bewitches him, making him fall completely in love with her. She is then free to drain him of his life force.","In areas where kawahime are known to appear, elderly villagers warn young men to stay clear of strange women by the rivers. When a kawahime is nearby, young men are told to keep their gaze pointed towards the ground, hold their breath, and walk away as quickly as possible.","More recent depictions of kawahime often give her kappa-like features, such as reptilian skin or webbed hands and feet.
The young man finally arrived at his friend’s home. When he told his friend what had happened, his friend warned him that the sword which cut her thread will have lost its ability to cut. He lent him a different sword for the journey home.
When the young man returned home, he passed through the same valley. The suspicious woman was waiting for him by the riverside. She challenged him saying, “Your sword which cut my thread cannot harm me!” However, the young man was carrying his friend’s sword. He cut the woman down, slaying her. That woman was actually a kawahime.","Kawahime may originate from ancient superstitions about outsiders. Long ago, when everyone in a village knew each other, it was rare to leave your home town. It would have been very suspicious to encounter a lone, unknown woman along a riverbank. If she were from a neighboring village, a young man would be courting trouble from her relatives by needless socializing with her. Cautionary tales about the dangers of unknown women and yōkai lurking at the outskirts of villages may have been invented to avoid strife with neighboring villages and help reinforce a community’s bonds.","A young man was traveling through a valley on his way to visit a friend. Near the riverside, he came upon upon a lone, beautiful woman coiling a spool of thread. The man found this suspicious. He thought she must be some kind of bakemono.

Their breath appears rainbow colored when they exhale. They sometimes carry spears which they use to assault humans. Like many animal yōkai, ōgama have the ability to change their forms and disguise themselves as humans.","When a Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus) reaches one thousand years of age, it transforms into an ōgama. Ōgama behave for the most part like they did when they were ordinary toads. They live deep in the mountains, usually by rivers. They hunt bugs, birds, and snakes by breathing their rainbow-colored breathe on them, and then snatching them up with their powerful, stretchy tongues.","Ōgama rarely come into contact with humans due to their remote habitat, but it does occasionally happen. When they rest, they are large enough that they can be mistaken for a large boulder or other natural mass, and a foolish person might accidentally sit on them. Even the smallest ōgama will commit evil deeds. When provoked, they are clever enough to wield spears and chase after humans. When they reach sizes of over three meters, they begin to see humans as food.","In Niigata Prefecture, a man went deep into the mountains to fish in a pond. He sat down on a boulder by the water’s edge and cast his line into the water. A fisherman on the other side of the pond noticed him. Suddenly the fisherman’s face went pale.

Ōgama appear in a number of Edo Period story collections, including Ehon hyakumonogatari and Hokuetsu kidan, but superstitions about toads go back much further.

Yakichi couldn’t understand how these little brats were beating him. He finally managed to grab on to one and was shocked to find he couldn’t make the kid move at all. He pushed and he pulled, but the kid didn’t budge.
It was getting late, and Yakichi’s family wondered why he hadn’t returned home yet. They lit lanterns and traveled along the road to look for him. They discovered Yakichi deep in the mountains with his arms wrapped around a big tree stump, heaving and straining to knock it over.
“Yakichi! What are you doing?” they asked him.
“I’m doing everything I can! But this kid won’t give up!” he grunted.
“You fool! That’s a mulberry tree!”
Yakichi stepped back and blinked his eyes. “So it is… How did that happen?” The expensive kimono he had worn to the party was tattered and torn all over, and completely ruined. It suddenly dawned on him that he had been tricked by shibaten into wrestling a tree stump.","The word shiba means a grassy lawn, but in this case it specifically means a small thing.

Folklorists have struggled to categorize them. Due to their name and their tall height, it has been suggested that they are somehow related to yama otoko, giants who live deep in the mountains. It has also been suggested that they are related to other river spirits, such as kappa or kawahime–however they do not harm humans in the way kappa and kawahime do, nor is tallness a common features among these yōkai.

Ika no Kōan knew that the octopus was lying. He wanted to object, but he was unable to speak out due to the octopus’ influence with the king.

He is merely described as a water god. However, because he appears every year around New Year’s, there is a strong possibility that he is related to other raihōjin–visiting gods–such as namahage and toshidoshi.
Unfortunately for Ichimoku nyūdō, before long the horse’s owner returned. He quickly captured Ichimoku nyūdō. While unmatched in the water, Ichimoku nyūdō was powerless on land. He could do nothing but prostrate himself before the human and beg for forgiveness.
“Please sir, forgive me! If you let me go, I promise to catch fresh fish for you every day from now on. I will string them up under the willow tree by the lake with my magic hook. Just promise to return my magic hook, so I can catch more fish the following day.”
The horse owner forgave Ichimoku nyūdō and released him back to the water. The next day, he visited the willow tree by Lake Kamo, and sure enough, there was a large, splendid, freshly caught fish hanging from the branches by a lapis lazuli hook. The man unhooked the fish and tossed the hook back into the water, then returned home. The following morning when the man returned to the willow, again a large, fresh fish was hanging from the branches. He took the fish and returned the hook to the lake. This continued for years.
One day, the man had a nasty idea. That morning, when he retrieved the fish from the tree, he decided not to throw the hook back into the lake. He kept it for himself. However, once he did that, he never again saw a fish hanging from the willow tree. Then, on the 15th day after New Year’s, Ichimoku nyūdō attacked the man’s house, causing all kinds of damage. He prayed all night long to Buddha for protection. When morning came the attacks stopped–it seemed his prayers had worked. However, every year on the same day, Ichimoku nyūdō would attack again.
The man was terrified. In order to protect himself from Ichimoku nyūdō’s wrath, he donated the lapis lazuli hook to a nearby temple dedicated to Kannon, the bodhisattva of compassion. The next year, Ichimoku nyūdō and an army of his underlings attacked the temple. The priests prayed throughout the night, and when morning came, they had been spared. Since then, every year on the 15th day after New Year’s, the priests at that temple prepare for Ichimoku nyūdō’s coming and prepare an all-night vigil to ward off his attack.
In some versions of the story, the horse owner sells the lapis lazuli hook to a merchant for a great sum. After that, Ichimoku nyūdō attacks his house and slaughters his entire family. The terrified villagers then erect a temple to Kannon to pray for salvation from Ichimoku nyūdō’s wrath.","There are many legends all over Sado Island about the one-eyed god of Lake Kamo.

It bowed, and then spoke to Tarō. It thanked him for rescuing his daughter the other day. As a reward, the turtle offered to take Tarō to Ryūgū, the palace of the dragon king of the sea.
Urashima Tarō climbed on to the turtle’s back. The turtle dove into the sea. Deeper and deeper they went, all the way to the bottom. They approached a splendid palace. A beautiful young princess named Otohime emerged from the palace and welcomed Tarō to Ryūgū.
Inside the palace, fish swam to and fro throughout the great hall. A great banquet was laid out for Urashima Tarō, and a party was thrown in his honor. He had never experienced such a grand feast or such hospitality. Otohime invited Tarō to stay in Ryūgū for as long as he liked. It was all like a dream. The beautiful princess served, and Tarō ate, and drank, and soon he lost all track of time.
One day, Otohime brought Tarō to a room in the palace with four great windows. She opened the first window, and behind it was a scene of spring, with birds chirping and flowers at the peak bloom. Tarō marveled at the beauty. Otohime opened the second window, revealing a scene of summer. Cicadas sung and a pleasant breeze fell on Tarō’s face. Next, Otohime opened the third window into a scene of autumn. Tarō marveled at the colorful foliage on the trees. Finally, Otohime opened the fourth window. Tarō stared out into a cold and snowy landscape. It looked like his fishing village, and felt homesick. He thought of his mother he had left behind, and how she must have been worrying about him. Tarō turned to Otohime and thanked her for the hospitality. Then he told her that must return to his home. Otohime begged him to stay, but Tarō would not change his mind.
When Otohime realized that Tarō could not be convinced to stay, she relented. She gave him a small box as a keepsake to remember his time at Ryūgū, and in hopes that they may meet again some day. But she warned him to never open the box. Tarō accepted the box with thanks, and then rode home on the back of a giant turtle.
When Tarō returned to his village, something seemed off. Everything looked different. He did not recognize anybody, nor did anybody recognize him either. He asked a villager if he knew the way to Urashima Tarō’s house. The villager replied that a fisherman by that name had gone out to sea and never returned. But that was over three hundred years ago. His family was long dead by now.
Tarō fell to his knees. Everything and everyone that he knew was gone. The only thing he had left was the box that Otohime had given him. In his despair, he forgot her warning and opened the lid. A puff a smoke from the box engulfed Tarō. When the smoke cleared, his beard had grown long, his hair had grown white, and his skin was wrinkled. In the blink of an eye, he had become an old man, for the box had contained the years that Urashima Tarō spent under the sea.","The Urashima legend is one of Japan’s most famous stories. The oldest recorded versions of the Urashima legend are found in 8th century works such as Nihon shoki, Manyōshū, and Tango no kuni fudoki. Early on he was known as Mizunoe Urashima, but by the middle ages the name Urashima Tarō had become widespread. His legend has changed considerably throughout the ages, in various details including his name, how long he spends away from home, the location that he visits, and so on. Despite this, they all follow the same pattern of a boy who rescues a turtle, visits a magical land, and returns to a world he no longer recognizes. The Urashima Shrine on the Tango Peninsula in Kyōto, founded in 825 CE, is dedicated to him.","Long ago lived a fisher boy named Urashima Tarō. Every day he went down to the sea and fished for food to support himself and his elderly mother.

They are covered in thick fur, but are slimy and slippery like catfish. They have a dish-like depression on the top of their heads.","Enkō are related to kappa and share many traits with other members of the kappa family. They are quite strong. They live in rivers and along the seashore, and are excellent swimmers. They often appear at night in popular fishing spots. They are also skilled at transforming and can disguise themselves as human women, dolls, and other forms.","Enkō are sometimes encountered by fishermen at night. They disguise themselves as kimono-clad wooden dolls and approach the fishermen. If poked, the dolls grin cheerfully and giggle.","Enkō have a strong revulsion towards metal objects and thus will run from farming implements.

In Shikoku, mountain spirits called shibaten migrate en masse into the rivers in the summer and transform into enkō. In Chūgoku, takiwaro live for three years in the mountains, then in the rivers for three more years before transforming into enkō.
However, enkō not always cute. They sometimes attack, rape, and even kill humans. They are best known for brutally assaulting swimmers in order to obtain one of their favorite snacks: the fresh liver from a still-living human. They obtain this by ramming one of their their long, flexible arms up through their victim’s anus and pulling out fistfulls of innards.","The kappa family of yōkai have long been associated with monkeys due to their long limbs, their migratory habits, their mischief, and hairy bodies. The enkō is one of the best examples of this association. Even the kanji for it name have been used since ancient times for various monkeys–猿 refers to the Japanese gibbon, while 猴 refers to the macaque. The word enkō is a synonym for monkeys in general, and it is likely that ancient people considered monkeys and kappa-type yōkai to be forms of the same creature.","In Tōsa Province (present-day Kōchi Prefecture), a woman was raped by an enkō.

Otobō is written with different characters from place to place, and it may be etymologically related to other guardian deities of water features, such as Otowa, Otaa, or even the princess of the ocean Otohime.
In Okaya, Nagano, near Hanaoka where the Tenryū River flows out of Lake Suwa, there is a deep abyss in which a six foot long catfish lived. This catfish killed and ate any humans who got close. It was greatly feared by the locals. The god of Hanaoka, a dragon named Ryūhō, sent a strong man named Otobō to slay the great catfish. Otobō fearlessly dove into the abyss and wrestled the great fish. He strung a rope through its gills, then he dragged it from the water and hoisted over his shoulder to carry back to Ryūhō. As he climbed a slope, the catfish began to thrash about and shout, “Farewell Otobō! Farewell Otobō!” Then the rope snapped and the catfish dove back into the abyss. Ever since then the slope has been called Namazusaka (“catfish slope”).
Near the border of Susugaya and Miyagase, Kanagawa, where the forest is so thick that it is dark even in the daytime, there is a deep pool called Otobō ga fuchi (“Otobō abyss”). Long ago, an old charcoal burner was carrying a heavy load when he passed by Otobō ga fuchi. He looked down into the water and saw the biggest catfish he had ever laid eyes on. It was so magnificent that he decided to catch it alive. The old man climbed down into the frigid water and waited patiently. Finally he was able to grab it. It was over four feet long. He dragged the catfish out of the water, emptied his sack of charcoal, and put the catfish in it. Thrilled with his catch, he started home.

People do not go to work, and you must stay indoors and remain silent all day. Going outside even to use the outhouse is forbidden–before modern plumbing was invented, villagers would prepare bottles and pots for that purpose. In case you have no choice but to go outside, you should place fragrant leaves in your hair or put a bag over your head. By all means you must never look in the direction of the ocean.","Traditions vary from island to island. In general, on the night of the 24th the kainan hōshi come ashore. Residents plug up the cracks of their doors and shutters with the fragrant leaves of false holly (Osmanthus heterophyllus) and mock orange (Pittosporum tobira). The following day, the sprigs are ceremonially burned. If they make loud noises while burning, it is a signal that the year’s harvest will be bountiful. On Miyake Island they travel from house to house and chant, “Give us dishes, give us pots, or else give us a human child!” Miyake Islanders place dishes in front of their houses and put their kids to bed early on the night of the 24th.
On Izu Ōshima these spirits are called Hiimisama and worshipped at a local shrine. A single family is tasked with receiving the Hiimisama as guests.

People who refuse to follow these superstitions soon meet with disaster. Those who fail to put leaves in their door cracks, or who open their doors during this period may lose the ability to speak, or contract psychological illnesses requiring hospitalization. People foolish enough to venture outside have returned home covered in blood, unable to explain what happened to them. Anyone who catches a glimpse of the kainan hōshi will die.
Another version of the legend says that kainan hōshi are the spirits of twenty five islanders who conspired against Tadamatsu. They murdered him on a dark and stormy night. Afterwards, they escaped into the rough seas riding in wooden washbasins. The conspirators sailed from island to island, but no villagers were willing to give them shelter. And so they were forced to roam the sea, until a storm on the 24th day of the 1st month capsized their ship and they all drowned. Their spirits became onryō. Every year on the anniversary of their deaths, they sail from island to island, cursing the faithless islanders who refused to shelter them.
Kainan hōshi share a number of similarities with funa yūrei, umi bōzu, and other seaborn ghosts. However, the superstitions and customs surrounding kainan hōshi suggest a connection with mikari baba, namahage, and other spirits classified as raihōjin–gods who visit during New Year’s. The dates, ritual purification, decoration of entrances, and receiving of potentially dangerous spirits as guests are features shared by a number of local traditions across Japan.","Kainan hōshi originate in an incident that took place in 1628. The governor of Hachijō Island, Toyoshima Tadamatsu, was a wicked lord who was hated by the islanders he ruled over. His subjects conspired to murder him.

On the 24th day of the 1st month, a storm came down upon Tadamatsu’s boat, and he was lost at sea. Tadamatsu’s vengeful spirit became an onryō.

Gaki are obsessed with food and driven solely by the desire to eat; yet they are never able to satiate their hunger. Their throats narrow so that they cannot swallow, and whatever food they do eat never satisfies their hunger.

A group of young men gathered in the farmer’s house to test the phenomenon. Sure enough, anytime one of them spoke, a voice from under the floorboards repeated back whatever they said.
They tried to guess the source of the voice. One of them called out: “You’re an old tanuki, aren’t you?”
“I am no tanuki!”
Another young man took a guess: “I know! You’re a kitsune!”
“I am no kitsune!”

“You’re a neko (cat)!”
“An itachi!”
“A kappa!”
“A kawauso!”
“An ugoromochi (mole)!”
The voice answered no to all of them.
Finally, one of the young men called out half-jokingly, “All right then, you’re a botamochi!”
The voice replied: “That’s right. I am a botamochi.”
After that the mysterious voice was referred to as a botamochi bakemono. News of it traveled throughout the village and eventually reached the castle. A number of government officials were sent to investigate. They spent the night at the farmer’s house and called out to the botamochi bakemono, but the strange voice remained silent for the while night.
After the government officials left, the voice once again began to repeat everything that the villagers said. Time and time again, government officials were dispatched to the house, but each time they visited, the botamochi bakemono remained silent. Eventually they had to give up and close their investigation.

Day after day, all of the fish in his tank were sold except for the female koi. For some reason she was always left unsold. She had a tomoe-shaped pattern in her scales. Naisuke named the koi Tomoe, and he became quite attached her.
Over time, Naisuke grew more and more fond of Tomoe. And the koi seemed to like him back. She seemed to be able to understand her own name, reacting like a human when he called her. Sometimes he took her out of the holding pond and let her sleep by his side in the house. As time passed, Tomoe even learned to eat meals like a human.
Tomoe grew larger and larger ever year. Eighteen years after she was caught, she had grown to the size of a fourteen or fifteen year old girl. Naisuke had aged too; now an elderly man, he accepted a marriage offer from an older, unwed woman in his village.
Not long after Naisuke’s bride came to live with him, Naisuke went out fishing all night and left his wife was alone at home. A beautiful young woman wearing a light blue kimono covered in crashing waves barged into the house through the back door. She glared at Naisuke’s wife and said, “Naisuke and I have been together for years, and I am even carrying his child! Now you dare act like his bride? I cannot contain my hatred! Leave our home immediately! If you do not, in three days I will call a giant wave to wash this entire house into the pond!” Then she vanished.
When Naisuke returned home, his terrified wife told him what had happened. Naisuke said that he had no memory of such a person.
“A beautiful young lady like you describe would surely have no interest in a poor, old fisherman like me!” he laughed. “You must have dreamed her up!
The following night, Naisuke went out fishing again. Suddenly, the water became rough. The algae on the surface parted, and an enormous koi leapt up out of the pond and onto the boat. It opened its mouth and spat out something that looked like a human fetus. Then it slipped back below the water and disappeared.

At a temple in the mountains, a strange man approached a young monk. The man used a mortar to grind up his own feces into a paste, and the ordered the young monk to eat the paste. The young monk protested, but the man became angrier and angrier, until the young monk had no choice but to obey. He was shocked to discover that the man’s feces were sweet and tasted just like a delicious persimmon. Later, the young monk told the temple’s high priest what had happened. The two of them searched for the strange man together. They saw him climb deep into the mountains and disappear. They followed his trail all the way to an huge, old persimmon tree loaded with ripe fruit. The high priest believed the man must have been the spirit of the persimmon tree.

The people who lived in the house were very old, and they no longer had the strength to pick the persimmons from their trees.

Before long, she heard the drums and cymbals of a funeral procession. A voice called out, “Where is the wild pear tree? Where is the wild pear tree?” The woman was terrified. A funeral procession at this hour must be an evil spirit.
The voice drew close and said, “Here it is! Here it is!” It came right below the pear tree, dug a hole in the earth, and buried a human corpse in it. The wife climbed higher up into the tree to get away, but the spirit heard her and said, “What have we here? I’m going to eat you!” A cold and slimy hand stretched up towards the wife.

Finally, Dōmo and Kōmo decided they would cut off each other’s heads simultaneously. The doctors prepared as the crowd watched. They cut off each other’s head at the same time.

A beautiful young woman emerged from the boat. She was about twenty years old, from an unknown foreign country. Her skin was pale and clean, and she stood 1.5 meters tall. She had red eyebrows and long red hair with extensions made of white fur or threads. She wore fine clothing made from unknown fabrics. She carried a plain-looking box, which must have been valuable because she would not put it down and would not let anyone touch it. The woman seemed polite and friendly, but her language was unrecognizable. Nobody could figure out where she came from.
Nobody knew what to do with the strange girl. One villager suggested that the woman might be a foreign princess. She may have been exiled for having an extramarital affair. Her lover was executed, but since she was a beloved princess, she was merely exiled to sea. The box she carried probably contained her lover’s head, which is why she guarded it so strongly.
The villagers worried that if she was indeed an exiled princess, they could be ordered to spend a great deal of money investigating her. They decided the best solution was to return her to sea and leave her to her fate. The strange woman was forced back into her boat and pushed out to sea again.","The most well-known utsurobune appeared in Hitachi Province (Ibaraki Prefecture) in 1803—in February at Harayadori according to one account, and in March at Haratonohama according to another.

Other utsurobune sightings took place in 1883 in Kōbe City, 1796 in Kaga Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), and in 1681 in Owari Province (Aichi Prefecture) and Echigo Province (Niigata Prefecture). They go back as far as the 7th century, when a girl named Wake hime was discovered in a strange round boat in Iyo Province (Ehime Prefecture). She claimed to be the daughter of the Chinese emperor.","In 1803, a strange vessel drifted to shore in Hitachi Province.

There was no way that Kamijinjii could carry everything off of the boat by himself, so he took a single gold and lacquer pot lid from the boat as evidence. Then he rushed back to the village to gather people to help him unload the rest of the treasure from the boat. However, by the time Kamijinjii and the other villagers arrived back at Habushiura beach the takarabune was gone, and there was no sign it had ever been there.","Takarabune evolved from the concept of harai, or spiritual cleansing—an ancient Japanese belief that spiritually unclean things can be cleansed or disposed of by washing them away down a river. A person’s first dream of the new year was an auspicious one, and a bad dream foretold a bad year. During New Year’s or Setsubun, images of ships were placed under the pillow before sleeping in order to catch bad dreams and keep them from coming true. The following morning the images were gathered and ritually discarded in river, carrying the bad dreams away with them like cargo ships. Over time more imagery was added to the ships, such as treasures, gods, and other symbols of prosperity and longevity, and they evolved into the ships of good fortune known as takarabune.","Long ago an old man named Kamijinjii lived on the island of Niijimamura. One day he was walking along Habushiura Beach when he came across the most beautiful sailboat that he had ever seen. There was no dock anywhere nearby, so he thought it strange that such a ship would be there. Even stranger, there was no crew. The ship was filled to the brim with gold and silver, precious art objects, and other treasures piled up on top of each other.",,

She became a renowned dancer and a prostitute, and eventually became a concubine of the warrior Soga Sukenari. One day, Sukenari’s enemy Kudō Suketsune sent an assassin to kill him while he was visiting Yamashita Chōja’s manor. The assassin fired an arrow, but it bounced off of him harmlessly. Then the assassin slashed at him with his sword, but again he could not harm him. Looking closely, the assassin saw that he had struck a large stone. It was Tora’s stone, which had magically disguised itself as Sukenari to save his life. The assassin fled, but the chips in the stone where the arrow and sword struck it remained as proof of its life-saving power.
The miraculous stone’s tale spread far and wide. It became the village of Ōiso’s famous tourist attraction, and people came from near and far to marvel at the stone. The stone is now enshrined at Endaiji, where it remains a popular attraction for worshippers seeking safe childbirth, protection, and other blessings.","Torakoishi was invented by Utagawa Yoshikazu in his series depicting the fifty stations of the Tōkaidō. Torakoishi appears playfully jumping at people in the print of Ōiso station. Its name is a pun based on a legendary stone named Toragoishi which was kept at Endaiji Temple in Ōiso, Kanagawa Prefecture. While the actual stone was named for a girl called Tora, Utagawa Yoshikazu used the literal meaning of the name Tora—tiger—to turn it into an animal yōkai.","In the late 12th century lived a samurai named Yamashita Chōja.

One night, Benzaiten appeared to her in a dream. The following morning, she awoke to find a beautiful stone placed next to her. Believing it to be a gift from the goddess, she worshipped the stone day and night. Her prayers were answered, and soon she was blessed with a baby girl.

Her perpetual youth and beauty were attained by accidentally eating the flesh of a ningyo—which is said to grant eternal life.,,,"During the meal, one of his guests snuck off into the kitchen to sneak a peek at this fish which everyone had all heard so much about. The guest recognized that it wasn’t a fish, but a ningyo. It was well known that ningyo flesh bestowed eternal life and youth on whomever ate it. He quietly warned the others what it was. Despite the promise of eternal life, the guests felt strange about eating the flesh of a yōkai, so they only pretended to eat the meat, secretly wrapping it up and hiding it in their sleeves to discard on the way home.
One of the guests, however, had gotten drunk and forgot to throw away his meat. At home, he absent-mindedly gave the leftovers to his teenage daughter. The next morning, he remembered what he had done and was filled with dread. He was sure that his daughter would be poisoned or cursed for eating yōkai meat. Days passed, but she showed no signs of distress. As she appeared alright, the man never bothered to say anything about the ningyo to his daughter. Soon the matter was forgotten entirely.
Many years passed, but the young girl never seemed to age a day. She got married. Her father grew old and died. Eventually, so did her husband. But no matter how many years passed, the girl remained as youthful and beautiful as she did in her teens. Everybody she cared for grew old and died while she never aged. She became sad and lonely, and eventually she joined a temple and became a nun. She left her hometown to travel the country, planting trees and helping people wherever she went.
After hundreds of years, Yaobikuni grew weary of the world. She retired in Wakasa Province, and took up residence in a cave. There she prayed day and night to be free of her curse. She never moved from the cave, and eventually she had sat for so long that she turned into stone. It is said that in one of the caves around Wakasa, there stands a stone that looks just like a beautiful, young woman.","Yaobikuni’s story is found over and over again in almost every region of Japan. Some details of her story vary from place to place, but the main points remain the same: a girl unknowingly eats something from the undersea world which causes her to live for a very long time, so she becomes a nun and travels around Japan. In many versions the girl is the daughter of a poor fisherman, while in some she is the daughter of a local noble, or even the daughter of legendary onmyōji Ashiya Dōman. In some versions of the story she becomes immortal by eating the flesh of a ningyo, in other versions it is a magical abalone or some other special food from Ryūgū. Across Japan there are towns with stories about trees that were planted by a traveling immortal nun centuries ago. There are official records of an eight-hundred year old nun visiting in Kyōto in 1449. In most tales, she finally ends up in Wakasa—southern Fukui Prefecture. It is possible that is where her story originated. A small cave located on the grounds of Kūinji, a Zen Buddhist temple in Obama, Fukui, is said to be her final resting place.","Long ago, a fisherman discovered a strange creature when he pulled up his nets.

She inherited the good looks of both of her parents, and was famous for her beautiful face.",Uondo fell in love with and married a human fisherman. She became a courtesan in order to help pay off her husband’s debts.,,"Years later, a fisherman named Heiji was fishing in Shinagawa harbor when a ningyo suddenly jumped up into his boat. It was the beautiful and flirtatious daughter of Urashima Tarō and Orino, now an adult. She asked Heiji to marry her. The ningyo was so beautiful, and Heiji was old and alone, so he agreed.
Heiji and the ningyo loved each other. However, Heiji was poor and had debt. The ningyo looked for ways to earn money to help her husband, but with her fish body and no arms, her options were extremely limited.
One day, a brothel owner named Denzō noticed the ningyo’s stunningly beauty face. He came up with a scheme to get rich off of her. Denzō offered her a great deal of money to come work for him as a courtesan. Seeing this as the only way to help her husband, she accepted.
Denzō made plans for the ningyo’s immediate debut as an oiran. He ordered a splendid kimono, and had her hair and make up done in the most fashionable way. In the style of high class courtesans, he gave her a professional name: Uondo. Then he held an extravagant procession to announce her debut at his brothel.
However, Uondo’s debut did not go well. Her lack of arms and legs meant that she could do little except flop around like a fish. Worse, the brothel’s best perfumes and incenses could not mask her fishy smell. On top of it all, she was so tired from preparations and the procession that she fell asleep immediately after welcoming her first customer into her room. Confused and repulsed, the customer left and demanded his money back.
Denzō was outraged. He returned Uondo to her husband and demanded that Heiji pay for the expenses he incurred organizing her debut. Heiji and the ningyo were even worse off than before.
Then, Heiji remembered a story about how eating the flesh of a ningyo granted eternal life and youth. If that were the case, then merely licking a ningyo should surely have at least some revitalizing effect. Heiji and the ningyo opened up a ningyo licking shop, offering single licks at very high prices. The people of Edo lined up in the streets for the opportunity to add a few years to their lifespans by licking the ningyo.
Heiji and the ningyo became rich and famous. They made enough money from their ningyo licking shop to pay off all of their debts, and to make sure they never wanted for anything again. They lived happily ever after.","Uondo comes from Hakoiri musume menya ningyo, a comical fairy tale written by Santō Kyōden in 1791. It capitalizes on the pop-cultural trends of 18th century Edo—the city’s famous red light districts, kabuki theater, the well-known legend of Urashima Tarō, and traveling sideshow spectacles called misemono which were all the rage at the time. A common misemono attraction was mummified yōkai, such as kappa and ningyo (mermaids), often made out of taxidermy by combining pieces of monkeys and fish. Kyōden’s fairy tale makes numerous references to misemono shows, as well as popular actors and celebrities of the day, and current events, making it a time capsule of Japanese pop culture in 1791.","Urashima Tarō was a playboy. He loved to visit the undersea kingdom’s red light districts and spend time with the beautiful aquatic courtesans there. One courtesan in particular—a carp named Orino—was so beautiful that Urashima Tarō fell madly in love with her. Orino loved the handsome Urashima Tarō as well. They spent many nights together, but because he was princess Otohime’s man, they could not remain together. Still, their love produced a child—a girl, who inherited the beauty of both of her parents.

Iwana which survive for many years and grow to an enormous size become iwana bōzu. They learn to transform into human shape, leave their rivers, and even speak.","Iwana bōzu appear out of nowhere and ask people who are fishing to stop and go home. They usually approach people catching more fish than they need to survive rather than those who are just feeding their families. In particular, they target those who use extreme measures of fishing, such as poisoning the river with Japanese pepper (Zanthoxylum piperitum), which causes fish to float to surface and makes them easy to catch. They lecture about refraining from needless killing, and taking life only when it is necessary to survive, and so on. Because they dress and speak in a manner that resembles a Buddhist priest, they are usually not immediately recognized as yōkai. It is only until later, after departing, that something seems off or strange and you realize that the person you thought was a priest was in fact a yōkai.","The young men replied that yes, they were using poison.
The priest asked them to stop fishing in that manner. It was a bad way to fish. It was cruel, and it caused excess death, which is a sin.
The young men protested that they had their own livelihoods to think of. But the priest persisted, and admonished them not to take unnecessary life. Eventually, out of politeness, they agreed to stop fishing with poison. The priest seemed satisfied, and the young men offered him some dango to eat. The priest gratefully accepted the food and then left.
After they finished lunch, the men went back to fishing. Despite what they had told the priest, they had no intention to stop using poison. Suddenly, the largest fish they had ever seen—over 180 cm in length—appeared in the river! They threw more and more poison into the river and were able to catch the giant fish.
Gleefully, the young men returned to their village laden with a huge catch. They decided to make a feast of the giant fish. As they prepared the fish, they cut open its stomach and out tumbled the dango that they had given to the priest!
The young men were so frightened that not one of them was willing to eat the fish.","Iwana bōzu stories can be found in all parts of Japan. In some areas, other fish species such as yamame (Oncorhynchus masou masou) and unagi (eels, Anguilla japonica) are also said to transform into people and admonish humans against cruel and excessive fishing. These stories vary in several details but all follow a similar narrative pattern. Common to all of them is the ending, in which the fish is killed and cut open, the contents of its stomach revealing its yōkai nature.","Long ago in Gifu, several young men were fishing by a stream.

Whether they say yes or no doesn’t matter; a daki is only interested in getting close to them. Once she is within range she attacks, draining the lifeblood from their body.","The fishermen of Saga’s islands are particularly fearful of daki. As a result, they have a particular way of securing their boats when stopping on an island to cook fish. They only drop the anchor, and do not tie up the boat with mooring lines. This way, if they need to escape in a hurry, they can simply cut the anchor line and be off.","The father was an experienced fisherman. He knew about daki and was immediately suspicious of the strange woman. He turned to his children and said, “Go back to the boat. Fetch a fish and bring it here.”
The children went to the boat, but since they had been swimming, not fishing, there were no fish. They called back, “We can’t find any fish!”
The father feigned confusion and said, “That can’t be! Let me see…” Then he made his way to the boat as if to help the children. When all three were in the boat, the father suddenly cut the anchor line and the boat was pulled out to sea.

You’re the dearest thing to me in the entire world.”
But the next day, the cat was gone. The old woman despaired. Everyone had abandoned her to poverty, even her last cat. She cried alone in her empty house.
Suddenly the door opened. A beautiful girl entered and introduced herself: “I am the calico cat whom you loved and cared for these many years. Please let me repay your kindness.” The girl looked human, with no trace of cat about her. The old woman could hardly believe her eyes.
“What do you plan on doing looking like that?” the old woman asked. “Besides, you owe me nothing.”
“You sacrificed everything for me. I cannot let you suffer. A man from Edo is in town scouting for girls to become geisha. Introduce him to me.” The girl displayed such earnestness that the old woman could not refuse. She arranged a meeting with the man from Edo.
When the man arrived, he was enchanted. “Such a beautiful girl could surely become a leading geisha in Edo!” he proclaimed. He offered the old woman a considerable sum of money—enough to live comfortable for the rest of her days—and took the girl with him back to Edo.
Several months later, a bewitching new geisha debuted in Fukagawa. She took the name Okesa, and rumors spread of her charm and beauty. She was described as a painting of a famous artist come to life. She sang songs that nobody had ever heard before. People flocked from all around to see and hear this mysterious geisha. Her restaurant was packed every night with customers who came to see the legendary Okesa with their own eyes.
One night, a sea captain and his crew visited the restaurant and asked for Okesa to perform for them. They threw a wild, lavish feast. Okesa sang, danced, and played shamisen for the sailors, who sang and danced along. They ate and drank all afternoon and evening. The party did not end until every one of them was splayed out across the floor, dead drunk. Only the captain managed to crawl into bed before passing out.
The captain woke up in the middle of the night. There was a crunching noise coming from the next room. He opened the door a crack and peered inside. A gigantic cat was chewing on the fish heads left over from the feast. The cat was dressed as a geisha—in the same kimono Okesa wore. It glared at the captain and said, “Tell nobody what you have seen. If you do, I will get you for it!” The captain was terrified. He nodded, closed the door, and hid under his covers.
The next morning, the sailors left the restaurant and returned to their boat. It was a beautiful day. The sky was clear and the water smooth—perfect weather for sailing. As they headed out to sea, the sailors reminisced about the incredible party they had had the previous night. They all agreed that they had never seen such a beauty as Okesa or heard such unusual songs as she had sung.
The captain, still shaken from what he saw, spoke up. “That geisha… None of you saw her true form…”
“What do you mean?” asked the crew.
“That geisha was a bakeneko!” The captain revealed the terrible fright he had had the previous night.
The sailors burst out laughing. Suddenly, the sky grew dark and storm clouds rolled in. The sailors cried, “Storm! Storm!” and ran to their posts. A gigantic cat emerged from the black clouds rolling over the boat. It grabbed the screaming captain and pulled him up into the sky.
The boat was tossed about on the rough seas like a leaf on the wind. The crew held on for dear life and screamed, “Please spare us! We swear to never tell anyone!”

They tried to slow its advance by dumping all of the tuna they had caught into their wake. But before long the umishika was upon them.
As the umishika was about to climb onto the ship, one of the fishermen grabbed an oar and thrust it with all of his might into the monster’s open mouth. The umishika fell back into the sea and stopped pursuing the boat. The fishermen rowed nonstop back to shore, exhausted from their effort but grateful for their lives.
The villagers decided that on that day it would be forbidden to enter not only the mountains, but the sea as well. From then on, both hunters and fishermen stayed home on the 16th day of the 5th month to make offerings and hold festivals for the gods of the mountains and seas.",Umishika come from the folklore of the island of Yakushima. A famous tale describes how umishika are responsible for a taboo against fishing during the 16th day of the 5th month of the old lunar calendar.,"Long ago, the 16th day of the 5th month was a holy day for the mountain gods.

They are larger than humans and resemble monkeys, with long, hairy manes that flow down their back.","Despite their size and strength, ijū are surprisingly shy and gentle yōkai. They mostly stay hidden away, deep in the mountains away from people. They seem to have some strange powers, but because ijū are so rare these are not well documented.","Ijū are occasionally encountered by couriers and other people who frequently travel across the mountains. Although they appear frightening, ijū do not attack people; the most they do is beg for food. In return, they sometimes offer help to people who are kind to them.","Takesuke sighed with relief. He smiled at the ijū and promised it half of his lunch on the return trip as well. Then he reached for the delivery pack to continue on his journey. But before he could take it, the ijū hoisted the pack onto its shoulders and began walking ahead of Takesuke. When the village of Tōkamachi came into view, the ijū placed the delivery pack on the ground and then dashed off into the mountains as swiftly as the wind. Thanks to the ijū, Takesuke crossed the mountains without much effort.
Since then, that same ijū was seen from time to time by villagers in the mountains, sometimes stopping at their homes to ask for food.
Another tale tells of a girl from Tōkamachi with such skill at the loom that wholesalers would request her weaving by name. One winter while she was home alone weaving, an ijū appeared just outside of her window. The girl was terrified, but because she was strapped into her loom she was unable to run away. However, the ijū did not appear threatening. Instead, it was hungrily staring at the rice cooking on her stove.
The girl slowly extricated herself from the loom, then went over to her stove and made several rice balls. She offered them to the ijū, who happily ate them and then scampered off into the mountains. From then on, whenever the girl was weaving alone, the ijū would emerge from the mountains and beg for food. She gradually became used to its presence, and no longer feared it.
One day, a rush order for fabric came from a very high ranking customer. It specifically requested the girl’s weaving. However, the girl’s period had just begun that day; and because menstruation was considered unclean, it was taboo for her to work. If she waited until she was able to work again, the deadline would be missed.
On the third day, her family left her home alone and went to work in the fields. Once again, the ijū appeared. The girl offered it some cooked rice which it happily ate as usual, but this time the ijū seemed to sense the girl’s anguish for her desperate situation. Instead of leaving immediately after eating like it usually did, the ijū sat down and seemed to concentrate or to medidate for a time. Then, it stood up and ran back into the mountains.
That night, the girl’s period miraculously ended. Astonished, she quickly purified herself and worked all night long to finish the order. In the morning, her father rushed to the wholesaler with the order. Everything was delivered it on time. Then, as soon as the payment for the order was made, the girl’s period began once again. Thanks to the ijū, the girl was able to complete her order.","Ijū come from the folklore of Niigata Prefecture. The two best-known stories about ijū appear in Hokuetsu seppu, a 19th century book that details the daily lives of people living in Japan’s “snow country.”","One summer in the village of Horinouchi, a man named Takesuke was tasked with delivering a large order of fabric to Tōkamachi—nearly 30 kilometers away across the mountains. Midway through the grueling trek, Takesuke stopped in a valley to rest and eat his lunch. Suddenly, a nearby thicket of bamboo trees parted, and a huge, hairy ijū stepped out. The ijū looked hungry and was eying Takesuke’s lunch. Takesuke split his lunch in half and offered to share a portion. The ijū happily gulped it down.",,

Mokichi accepted Ohama as his wife and welcomed her into his home. Not only was she beautiful, her cooking was astonishingly good. In particular, her miso soup was beyond anything Mokichi had ever tasted. Mokichi asked Ohama how she was able to make such tasty soup, but she refused to tell him. What’s more, Ohama warned Mokichi that he must never see her cook, and she made him promise not to.
Mokichi kept his promise for a time, but the secret of Ohama’s cooking nagged at him. How could her miso soup be so delicious? Eventually his curiosity got the better of him. Mokichi peeked into the kitchen. What he saw shocked him: Ohama was straddling over the cooking pot and urinating into it!
That night, when Ohama served Mokichi his dinner, he was oddly silent. She encouraged him to drink his miso soup, but he refused. Then Ohama guessed what had happened.
“You saw me, didn’t you?” she asked.
Mokichi nodded.
Ohama turned around and walked out the door. She went to the seaside, knelt at the water’s edge, and cried. Slowly she changed back into her true form: she was the giant clam whose life Mokichi had spared.

A young woman appeared at the door. She said, “Excuse me, but if anybody would do, would you take someone like me as a bride?”
The old man was delighted. “Come in! Come in! No woman has ever come to our home before. But I’ve always said that if anybody was willing to marry my son, anybody would do. And I think you’ll do just fine!”
The old man and his son welcomed the woman into their home. She was sopping wet from head to toe—strange, they thought, as it hadn’t rained for days. But they sat her by the fire to dry off anyway. She was extremely short—no larger than a child of three or four years. She was so small that she couldn’t do any heavy housework; although she was willing to perform any chore that was light enough for her. But the old man and his son had said that anybody would do, and they thought she was good enough.
One day, the woman needed to return to her family to attend a memorial service for her father. Although they were poor, the old man and his son scraped together a small bag of rice for her to bring to her family as a gift. They placed the sack of rice on the woman’s back, but the weight was too much for her to bear and she was squashed flat. The two men scooped rice out of the bag until it contained just 5 cupfuls, after which the bride returned to her normal shape and stood up. She was able to carry the smaller load, albeit with some difficulty. She thanked them for the gift and left the house. But the old man was suspicious of the young woman’s severe frailty. He instructed his son to follow her to see what kind of place she came from.
The woman traveled across town, then deep into the mountains. Her husband followed from a distance, and thought it very strange, as there were no homes that far up the mountain. Finally, she stopped at the edge of a marsh. She looked left, then right, and then plop! She jumped into the water. The young man rushed towards the edge of the marsh. He couldn’t see her anywhere in the dark water. He leaned in close to the water and listened. The only sound was the croaking of frogs… but they seemed to be speaking!
“What happened? How come you’re so late? We’ve been waiting a long time for you!”
“I know… It’s because I had to carry this rice! They gave me a whole bag of rice, and it squashed me flat. I couldn’t get here any faster.”
“Anyway, the priest is already here. Let’s begin the memorial service.”
The sound of frogs croaking out Buddhist prayers filled the air. The young man was repulsed. He had been tricked into marrying a frog! He picked up a rock and hurled it into the water. There was a big splash, and the croaking stopped. The man left the pond and returned home. He told his father everything.
Late that night, the woman returned to her husband’s home. “I’m sorry it took so long!” she said as she entered the house.
“How was the memorial service?” asked the old man.
“Oh wow… well it started out fine. But then a huge rock fell from the sky and hit the priest on the head—right in the middle of his prayers! It was a huge mess!”
The young man shouted at his bride. “What are you saying? You’re a frog! I saw everything! It was I who threw the rock!”
“You saw me?!” The girl was mortified. She covered her face in embarrassment. Then she transformed back into a frog and, croaking, hopped out the door. They never saw her again.
And that’s why in marriage you must never say that anybody at all will do.","Stories about frog brides are found all over Japan. Although the minor details vary from region to region and story to story, they often contain similar themes and follow similar patterns, such as a frog priest being struck by a rock.

A beautiful young woman in traveling clothes was standing in the snow. It was cold, dark, and a terrible hour to be traveling alone. The woman asked if she could pass the night in the man’s home. He pitied her and welcomed her inside, giving her a seat by the fire and what little food he had.
The next day, the man went out to gather firewood. When he returned, the woman was still there. She had cleaned the whole house. The woman stayed that night too, and the night after that. She made no mention of continuing her journey and the man did not ask her about it.
One day the woman told the man that she would like to be his wife. The man could not believe that such a beautiful woman would want to marry someone as poor as him. But she assured him that she had thought carefully about her decision, so he happily accepted. For a wedding gift, she asked him to build her a loom so that she could weave a brocade. She asked her husband to leave her alone in her workroom for seven days, and she made him promise that he would not look in on her while she worked.
The man listened to the clack-clack-boom of the loom as his wife worked. But he kept his promise and did not spy upon her. After the seventh day she emerged from her workroom, exhausted, yet carrying the most splendid fabric the man had ever seen. She instructed him to take the brocade into town and sell it to the lord for one thousand ryō. He was astonished—could it really be worth such a lordly sum?
The man did as she asked. The lord bought the fabric for one thousand ryō, and he commanded the man to bring him another brocade just like it. The man returned home with his fortune and told his wife of the lord’s order. She seemed reluctant; however they could not disobey the lord’s command. She agreed to weave one more brocade. Again, she had her husband promise not to look upon her while she wove.
The husband listened to the clack-clack-boom of the loom as his wife worked. But this time, curiosity overpowered him. He wondered how she could weave such an extraordinary brocade when they didn’t own even a single spool of thread. He opened the door to the workroom and peaked inside. Working the loom, where his wife should have been, was a crane. The crane was pulling out its own feathers one by one, using them as thread to weave the fabric. Its body was covered in painful red spots and nearly plucked bare. The man quietly closed the door and let the crane finish its work.
After the seventh day the wife emerged from the workroom, looking gaunt. She carried a brocade equal in splendor to the first one. It would surely sell for one thousand ryō. The wife gave the fabric to her husband and looked at him with sad eyes. She confessed that she was the crane he had saved from a hunter. She had changed into a human to be by his side and repay his kindness. But since he had broken his promise and spied upon her, she could no longer stay with him. Though it was brief, she would cherish their time together forever.

In return for renouncing evil and following the Buddha, they have been set free from the torments that plague other dragons, such as being preyed upon by karura. They live in great underwater palaces where they collect treasures—especially Buddhist relics and texts. They have god-like powers, and are worshiped by farmers, fishers, and others who rely on water for their livelihood.",,"The most famous ryūō are the hachidai ryūō—the eight great dragon kings who were present when the Buddha gave the Lotus Sutra and converted to Buddhism.
Nanda (Sanskrit: Ānanda; bliss) is the highest ranking of the dragon kings. He is the older brother of Batsunanda (Sanskrit: Upananda, meaning wholesome bliss). These brothers are both highly revered as gods of the winds and rains. They are the target of worship in Shō’u kyōhō, a Buddhist prayer for rain and for protection from floods and other natural disasters.
Shagara (Sanskrit: Sāgara; ocean) is the dragon king of all the ocean. He lives in a great palace at the bottom of the sea called Ryūgū. He is the father of Zennyo Ryūō, a benevolent dragon goddess of rainmaking who appears in several Buddhist legends.
Washukitsu (Sanskrit: Vāsuki; many heads) is a many-headed dragon who is associated with Kuzuryū, a nine-headed Japanese serpent god. In Indian mythology, he used his long body like a rope to help the gods churn the cosmic ocean of milk. This produced a number of fantastic substances, including the nectar of immortality which the gods drink in order to maintain their long lives and wisdom.
Tokushaka (Sanskrit: Takshaka; poisonous gaze) possesses a deadly poison. He can kill a person simply by staring at them, although he uses this power to fight evil spirits rather than hurt people. He is the father of Kisshōten, a goddess of happiness, fertility, and beauty.
Anabadatta (Sanskrit: Anavatapa; heat free) is the most virtuous of all the dragon kinds. He is a god of cool, clear water who lives in a lake in the north of the Himalayas. He provides the land with clean water from the top of the world by sending it down the four great rivers: Ganges, Indus, Amu Darya, and Tarim.
Manashi (Sanskrit: Manasvin; large body) is a big dragon with a strong sense of compassion. When the ashura attacked the emperor of heaven’s palace with seawater, he used his large body to push the water back into the sea.
Uhatsura (Sanskrit: Utpalaka; blue lotus) lives in a beautiful pond where blue lotus flowers bloom. He observes all of the deities of the land and helps them regulate the rains and winds in order to bring about good harvests.","Japanese dragons are a complex mixture of several cultural traditions. Ryūō are based on the nagaraja—snake kings of Indian mythology—which were adapted into Buddhism. As Buddhism spread from India into East Asia, India’s naga merged with China’s long, and absorbed many aspects of Chinese folklore and religion. In Japan they further mixed with existing Japanese snake and dragon cults. Due to centuries of religious syncretism, dragons with Chinese or Indian origins and those with Japanese origins can be difficult to distinguish. Some came to be viewed as different incarnations of the same being. However, there are also many Shintō and Buddhist dragons which resemble one another yet are considered to be separate individuals.","Eight ryūō were present when the Buddha delivered the Lotus Sutra, along with several other supernatural beings including ten, yasha, kendatsuba, ashura, karura, kinnara, and magoraka. Together with the ryū, these eight races are known as the hachibushū—the eight legions. They were so impressed by the Buddha’s teachings that they converted, pledging themselves to be guardians of Buddhism. While they have the appearance and ferocity of demons, they are actually benevolent warrior gods.",,

She sometimes appears in the form of a large serpent riding a cloud and wearing a small golden snake like a crown. At other times, she is depicted as a female or male human wearing ancient Chinese imperial clothing.","Zennyo is the daughter of Shagara Ryūō, one of the eight great dragon kings. She is wise, clever, and aware of the deeds of all sentient beings in the universe. She is eloquent, virtuous, compassionate, and merciful. At a very young age, she understood all of the teachings of the Buddha and became enlightened.","Zennyo is worshiped at several shrines and temples, including Shinsenen and Kongōbuji on Mount Kōya in Wakayama. Both institutions are connected to Kūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism and a highly influential monk who was the first to worship Zennyo in Japan. At Daigōji in Kyōto she is worshipped as Seiryū Gongen.","In 824 CE, during the reign of Emperor Junna, there was a great drought. The emperor asked the rival abbots Shubin of Saiji Temple and Kūkai of Tōji Temple to pray for an end to the drought. Shubin went first. He prayed and performed rituals for seven days, but only a few drops of water fell, and only over the capital. Next, Kūkai went. He performed the Shō’u kyōhō rainmaking ritual for one week, but not a single drop of rain fell.
Kūkai thought this was strange, so he investigated. He discovered that Shubin had grown jealous of Kūkai’s fame and had used a magical spell to capture all of the dragon gods in a water bottle. Shubin was responsible for the drought. However, one dragon god was a bodhisattva, and thus too powerful to be captured by Shubin’s magic: Zennyō, who lived in a lake in northern India.
Kūkai continued praying for two more days, this time to Zennyo Ryūō. A 2.7 meter long serpent wearing a 24 centimeter long golden snake as a crown appeared and slithered into the pond at Shinsenen. Suddenly the sky grew dark and rain began to fall. It continued for three days and nights, raining all across Japan. The drought was over.","Zennyō is described in the Lotus Sutra as the eight-year-old daughter of Shagara. During a discussion about how anyone who practices the Lotus Sutra can become a buddha in a single lifetime, she is presented as an example of one such being. Her diligent study of the sutra allowed her to instantly achieve buddhahood. This claim was met with skepticism by many. It was believed that women were unclean and impure, and thus could never attain enlightenment. On top of that, Shakyamuni was only able to attain that stage after a long period of difficult, incessant religious practice; surely a young girl could not reach enlightenment at all, let alone faster than the Buddha himself. But Zennyō proved them wrong by changing herself into a man, perfecting all of the spiritual practices, preaching the dharma, and instantly attaining enlightenment before their eyes. As they witnessed her become a buddha, the onlookers rejoiced, and understood that salvation was attainable by anyone.","The most famous story about Zennyō Ryūō is recorded and expanded upon in several histories, such as Konjaku monogatarishū and Taiheiki.",,

Their details vary from place to place and legend to legend.,,"Like most dragons, kuzuryū have power over rain and water. Shrines dedicated to them are usually organized around praying for rain and for the health of nearby rivers, and for protection from floods.","The Hakone Shrine in Kanagawa tells of a kuzuryū who lived in Lake Ashi. For years it tormented the villagers of Hakone by summoning storms and making the lake dangerous for boats. Every year the villagers selected a young girl to offer up as a sacrifice to appease the venomous nine-headed dragon who lived in the lake. In 757 CE, a priest named Mangan heard of these human sacrifices and went to save the people of Hakone. He bound the serpent to an upside-down cedar tree at the bottom of the lake and preached Buddhist teachings until it repented. The kuzuryū apologized for its evil deeds and promised to forever be a protective spirit of the lake. It offered three precious artifacts—an orb, a scepter, and a jug—to the people, and Mangan established a shrine honoring the kuzuryū.
The Kuzuryū River, which flows from Mount Haku through Fukui Prefecture is named for a nine-headed dragon who lives at the mountain’s peak. In 717 CE, a monk named Taichō made a pilgrimage to the summit of Mount Haku. While meditating beside Midorigaike Pond, a holy dragon with nine heads emerged from the water. The kuzuryū revealed itself to be an avatar of the Shintō goddess Izanami, while Taichō recognized it as a manifestation of the eleven-faced Kannon, a Buddhist goddess of mercy. Soon after, Taichō established the Hakusan Faith and built the temple Heisenji. In 889 CE, a nine-headed dragon appeared before a congregation of priests at Heisenji. The dragon was seen in the river, carrying a statue of itself downstream. After that, the river came to be known as the Kuzuryū River.","Kuzuryū legends can be found all over Japan. In some places, the worship of nine-headed dragon gods predates recorded history, while others are more recent. In Buddhism, nine-headed dragons are often associated with Washukitsu Ryūō (Sanskrit: Vāsuki), a many headed dragon who heard the teachings of the Buddha and gave up his evil ways. As Buddhism spread throughout Japan, many kuzuryū legends came to be viewed as local manifestations of Washukitsu.","The Togakushi Shrine in Nagano Prefecture is home to a famous kuzuryū legend. In 849 CE, a monk named Gakumon took up residence in a cave on Mount Togakushi. As he recited the Lotus Sutra, a fearsome kuzuryū appeared before him. The dragon told him that he was once the steward of a nearby temple, but he stole the donations made to the temple and kept them for himself. His sin caused him to transform into a dragon. As he listened to Gakumon’s recitations, he finally achieved enlightenment. The dragon pledged to remain in the cave and protect the area, and Gakumon sealed the cave’s entrance with a boulder. After that, the dragon blessed the land with rain and water. He was also especially good at curing toothaches for anyone who left him an offering of his favorite food: pears.",,

Kawaguma can be more than a nuisance, though, as they sometimes dig at riverbanks, breaking them and causing floods.",,"Also on the Omono River, late one night a ferryman at Tsubakigawa had just finished tying up his boat on the riverbank  when suddenly he heard a splash in the water behind him. He saw a pair of hands clinging to the side of the boat. The ferryman was surprised, and chopped at the hands with a large knife. When morning came, he discovered a severed hand inside the boat. It was black and hairy, and resembled a cat’s paw. Everyone who saw it said it was the kawaguma’s hand.","Kawaguma come from the folklore of northern areas, especially the Omono River Akita Prefecture and the Shinano River in Niigata Prefecture. Kawaguma appear in Tsuki no Dewa michi, one volume of a large Edo period travelogue by Sugae Masumi detailing stories and observations from the author’s experiences in Dewa Province.","Long ago a lord went hunting in his boat down the Omono River. Suddenly a hand covered in black fur stretched up from the bottom of the river and snatched his rifle away.

Their distant laughter is often heard late at night by woodcutters and travelers who find themselves in the mountains past dark.,"Despite their non-threatening appearance, warai onna are quite dangerous. Those who travel into mountains where warai onna live risk their lives. Upon meeting a warai onna, she will smile and laugh at a person. Their laughter is infectious, and often causes those who meet them to laugh along too. However, even after the warai onna leaves, the people who laughed along with her will continue, rolling on the ground laughing until they are out of breath and unable to stand. These fits of laughter progress into a terrible fever which, after a few days, kills its victims.","Even those who resist laughing along with a warai onna are not safe. Merely hearing their laughter is enough to induce psychosis. A warai onna’s laughter can drive those who hear it to madness. They begin to hear mocking laughter wherever they go—even from rocks, trees, water, and wind. Those who survive such an encounter are doomed to hear this yōkai’s mocking laughter wherever they go, for the rest of their lives.
Legends also tell of warai otoko—male versions of the same yōkai. They behave exactly the same way as warai onna. A related yōkai invented by Toriyama Sekien and called kerakera onna (“cackling woman”) has almost the exact same features as warai onna, except that she appears in red light districts instead of mountains.","Warai onna come from the folklore of Kōchi Prefecture. They are said to appear in the mountains on fixed days: the first, ninth, and seventeenth days of every month. Because of this, locals warn others to stay out of the mountains on those days.","Long ago, a samurai named Higuchi Kandayū ignored the villagers’ warnings and went hunting with his retainers on Mount Tōkō on the ninth day of the month. On the trail, a beautiful woman around seventeen or eighteen years old appeared before him. She pointed a finger and laughed at him. As she laughed, her voice grew higher, and louder, and fiercer. Soon it seemed to Kandayū that the entire mountain was laughing at him. The trees, the rocks, the rivers, and even the wind seemed to echo her laughter. Kandayū and his retainers fled in terror, and when they finally exited the mountains, his retainers all fainted. Although he escaped successfully, Kandayū was haunted by that laughter, which echoed in his ears until he died.",,

It is the primary residence of the dragon god of the sea and his daughter Otohime, and is home to the ocean’s royal court. The palace is populated by aquatic creatures who wear human clothing and have a society which mirrors that of the human world.",,"Despite being separated from the human world, there are plenty of stories about humans and inhabitants of Ryūgū visiting each other, such as when a jinja hime appeared off the coast of Hizen Province in 1819 to foretell a bumper crop followed by a cholera epidemic. Fabulous treasures from the dragon palace are sometimes given to human visitors—such as kanju and manju, the pearls which control the ebb and flow of the tides, and the tamatebako of Urashima Tarō’s legend.","Ryūgū is a complex of many buildings. It is composed largely of coral, pearl, and crystal, while other precious materials such as gems, gold, silver, and fish scales are used in its construction. One of its most famous features is its gardens, which contain all four seasons at the same time. The eastern gardens are in perpetual spring. Cherries, plums, and willows are always in full bloom, swaying in the spring breeze, and the songs of nightingales can be heard from within the cool mist. The southern gardens are in endless summer. Dew-covered hydrangeas and lotus blossoms decorate the gardens, and waterfowl playing in the ponds send cool waves to lap the shores. The trees are thick and lush, and the sky reverberates with the ringing of cicadas and the singing of cuckoos. In the western gardens, autumn reigns. The trees display brilliant yellows and reds, while white chrysanthemums decorate the ground. Deer graze in the dewy grass, and call out into enveloping fog. In the north it is always winter. The treetops are barren, their dead leaves twinkling with frost. The mountains are covered in a blanket of powdery snow, and thin wisps of charcoal smoke rise out from distant chimneys.
The location of Ryūgū varies from story to story; it can be accessed through caves, at the bottom of rivers or lakes (such as Lake Biwa, Japan’s largest lake), along the coast, or on a floating island in the distant ocean, but most often it is said to lie on the bottom of the sea. The palace can be seen on the ocean’s distant horizon, in mirages made from clams’ breath—or shinkirō.
Time passes at a different rate in Ryūgū compared to the outside world. Although the rate differs from story to story, one day spent at Ryūgū is usually equivalent to several years or more on the surface. Humans who visit Ryūgū for an extended period return to the surface world to discover that it has changed dramatically since they left.","In early Japanese mythology this palace was called Watatsumi no miya, named for Watatsumi—the god of the sea. Like other Japanese deities, Watatsumi was depicted with a human-like form. During the middle ages, as aspects of Chinese mythology and Buddhism were absorbed into Japanese mythology, the idea that the ocean was ruled by ryūō—dragon kings—became popular. The name Ryūgū and the depiction of the god of the sea as a dragon have since became the popular standard.","The most famous account of Ryūgū comes from the legend of Urashima Tarō, the young man who rescued a turtle and was brought to the palace as a reward. He spends some time there and even falls in love with the beautiful princess Otohime, but his story ends tragically when he returns to the surface world only to find that centuries have elapsed and everyone he ever knew is dead.",,

Within the palace, she is usually portrayed as a beautiful human woman, but her true form is usually that of a turtle or a crocodile-dragon known as a wani.","There are many different versions of this legend, and Otohime’s part in them changes from one to another. However, she is most famous for falling in love with a human named Urashima Tarō. In most stories she meets Urashima Tarō after a turtle carries him to Ryūgū on its back. In some versions of the legend that turtle is Otohime herself.",,"In many stories Urashima Tarō leaves Ryūgū after a few days and never returns. In other versions, he stays for years, and he and Otohime produce a child. And in some tales, due to the difference in their ranks, Urashima Tarō is more like a concubine or a kept man to Otohime.
Otohime’s name is actually a title meaning “second princess.” It was improper to refer to royalty by their given names, so she is only known as Otohime, or “the second princess” of the dragon king. Legends don’t usually mention anything about her older sister, but she would have been called Ehime (“first princess”).
Otohime is commonly associated with certain mythological and religious figures. In Shintō, Otohime is often said to be either Toyotama hime or Tamayori hime, the daughters of the sea god Watatsumi. In Buddhism, she is described as the second daughter of Shagara, the dragon king who rules the sea. The similarities between Shintō and Buddhist myths, centuries of syncretism, and the popular retelling of her tales over the years makes separating Otohime’s various origins from each other difficult, if not impossible.","The Urashima Tarō story is one Japan’s oldest and most well-known legends, so Otohime has appeared in countless tales—from ancient fairy tales to modern manga and anime.

He fled to a distant fortress and raised an army of sharks and whales with the intent of attacking Ryūgū.
The regent remembered Ise Ebizō’s honor and loyalty to the former king, and he restored his position at court. At the same time, he did not forget the octopus’ treachery and disloyalty. They set a trap for the octopus, luring him back to Ryūgū with the promise of honors and rewards for his service. Then they sprinkled ash all over the palace floor. When the octopus arrived, his feet could not grip the ashy floor, and he was unable to move. Ise Ebizō stepped forth and challenged the octopus.

Hoori lived with Toyotama hime in Ryūgū for three years, but then remembered his quest to find the missing hook and he grew depressed. Tamayori hime told her father the sea god, who asked Hoori what was wrong. Hoori explained his problem. The sea god summoned all of the fish in the ocean and asked if any of them had seen the hook. A tai complained of a pain in its throat that was preventing it from eating. Upon inspection, a hook was discovered lodged in its throat. It was the hook that Hoori was searching for. The sea god returned the hook to Hoori. He also promised Hoori that he would send rain upon his fields and make him rich, while denying rain to his older brother’s fields. He lent the tide-controlling jewels manju and kanju to Hoori to defend himself against Hoderi’s attacks. Then he set Hoori on the back of an enormous dragon for his return trip to the surface world.
Sure enough, the sea god’s interventions caused Hoderi’s harvests to grow poor and poorer while Hoori’s grew richer and richer, spurring Hoderi to attack Hoori. Using the power of the tide-controlling jewels, Hoori raised the tide and drowned his older brother, forcing him into submission. Only when Hoderi promised to serve Hoori for the rest of time did Hoori lower the tide again.
During this time Toyotama hime became pregnant with Hoori’s child. When her delivery grew near, she and her sister Tamayori hime came to the surface world on the back of a giant turtle to give birth. She asked Hoori to build her a birthing hut thatched with cormorant feathers along the shore, but she went into labor before he was able to complete it. Toyotama hime entered the hut.

Toyotama hime was ashamed at having her true form revealed. Although she desired to remain on the land, she returned to Ryūgū, leaving her newborn child behind.

Sea creatures act as Ryūjin’s servants and emissaries, delivering his messages to humanity—including prophecies of bumper harvests or warnings about upcoming disasters. Ryūjin’s daughters—Otohime, Toyotama hime and Tamayori hime, or Zennyo Ryūō, depending on the tradition—occasionally interact directly with humans as well.
Ryūjin sometimes lends or gives treasures to humans to help them accomplish great deeds—for example, the bottomless sack of rice given by Ryūjin to Fujiwara no Hidesato in return for slaying an ōmukade.
Perhaps the most famous of Ryūjin’s gifts are the tide-controlling jewels kanju (干珠) and manju (満珠). With these pearl-like treasures, a person can cause the tides to recede (kanju) or rise (manju) dramatically. They appear in several legends and folktales. When Ryūjin’s son in law Hoori fought his brother Hoderi, Hoori was able to use manju to nearly drown his brother and force him to submit. During the legendary 3rd century Empress Jingū’s invasion of the Korean peninsula, she used kanju to lower the ocean and strand the enemy’s ships on the sea floor. Then she used manju to raise the water and destroy the stranded fleet.
The turtle swam to shore and soon found a monkey up in a tree. The turtle told the monkey that Ryūjin was holding a feast in Ryūgū, and the monkey was invited. The monkey replied that he had always wanted to visit Ryūgū. The turtle told the monkey to climb onto his shell, and then he carried the monkey down to the dragon palace.
At Ryūgū, the monkey was treated to a feast the likes of which he had never experienced. There was singing and dancing, and more food and sake than he could imagine. The monkey feasted and drank so heavily that soon he collapsed in a drunken haze. But the doctors reminded Ryūjin that the liver had to be extracted from a living monkey—a dead one would not do. So Ryūjin ordered his servants to take the monkey outside and sober him up.
The royal guards—a jellyfish and a flounder—carried the monkey outside to the courtyard. As they dragged the monkey’s semi-conscious body, they laughed to themselves, “What a stupid monkey! He doesn’t even know that we’re going to cut out his liver.” But the monkey was still semi-conscious, and he heard what they said. He pulled himself up onto his feet and told the guards he needed to speak to the turtle.
When the turtle arrived, the monkey told him, “Oh, turtle! I just remembered something terrible! When you found me, I was hanging my liver on a tree branch to dry. I was so excited to come to the party that I left it behind. And it looks like it might rain… If my liver gets wet it will be ruined! Please, take me back to the shore so I can get my liver.”
“If the monkey’s liver were ruined, it would be a disaster,” thought the turtle. So he quickly carried the monkey on his shell back to the shore. Once on land, the monkey climbed up into a tree and stayed there. The turtle called up to ask if he found his liver. The monkey shouted down at the turtle, “You idiot! A liver is not something you hang from a tree! I overheard the jellyfish and the flounder talking about your plan, and I will never return to the sea again!” Then the monkey started hurling rocks at the turtle. One of them chipped his shell.
The turtle retreated back to Ryūgū and reported what happened to Ryūjin. The dragon king was so angry that he cut the flounder’s body in two, and he pulled all of the bones out of the jellyfish’s body. Then he banished them from Ryūgū forever. That is why jellyfish must float about near the surface, and why flounders must lie flat on their sides.",,"Long ago, Ryūjin’s daughter Otohime fell gravely ill. The royal doctors said that she could be cured by medicine made from the liver of a living monkey. Of all the sea creatures, only the turtle is able to climb onto the land where monkeys live. So Ryūjin sent a turtle to the surface world to bring down a living monkey.",,

She is usually depicted in the traditional dress of ama, bare-breasted and carrying a knife used to pry crustaceans from the rocks.",,,"As the ship passed near the shore of Shidō in Sanuki Province, the sky grew dark and the sea grew furious. As the waters washed over the deck, a great dragon was spotted swimming between the waves—it was Ryūjin. He snatched Menkōfuhai no Tama from the ship and then sunk down to the sea floor, taking the priceless jewel with him.
When Fujiwara no Fuhito heard of the theft of Menkōfuhai no Tama, he went to Shido to search for it, disguising himself as a commoner named Tankai. While investigating the whereabouts of the jewel, he fell in love with an ama named Tamamo, the daughter of a fisherman. Together they had a son, whom they named Fusasaki, and for several years they lived happily as a family.
One day, Fujiwara no Fuhito decided to reveal his noble identity and his reason for coming to Shido to his wife. As an ama, Tamamo was able to dive down to the bottom of the sea—perhaps even all the way to Ryūgū. And so, out of her love for Fuhito, she resolved to recover the lost jewel for him or to die trying.
Tamamo dove into the sea, carrying only an ama’s knife and one end of the lifeline held by her husband on the shore. She swum deeper than she ever had gone before. She slipped into Ryūgū and found Menkōfuhai no Tama. Ryūjin himself was guarding it. Tamamo quickly snatched the jewel. Then she swam towards the surface harder than she ever had before. Her life depended on it.
Ryūjin was furious. He sent a swarm of sea creatures after Tamamo. Armed with only a small knife, she fought as hard as she could; but her breath was failing and she was no match for the forces of the dragon king. Tamamo knew she would not make it to the surface. With her knife, she cut deep into the flesh under her breast and pressed the jewel into her body. Then she tugged on the lifeline, signalling for Fuhito to real her in.
Fuhito pulled the rope as quickly as he could, but it was too late. He pulled Tamamo’s battered body out of the sea and cradled her. With her last breaths, she told him where she hid the jewel, and she begged him to look after their son. Then she died in his arms.
Fuhito was overcome with grief. He swore to honor her sacrifice by raising their son to be a great man. He laid Tamamo’s body to rest in Shido-ji, and then he took Fusasaki to the capital and educated him as a noble. Fusasaki became Fujiwara no Fusasaki, a great minister and the head of the most powerful branch of the Fujiwara clan. When Fusasaki learned of his mother’s great sacrifice, he made a pilgrimage to her grave in Shido. He built one thousand stone pagodas in her honor, and expanded the small temple into a great one.
The graves of the ama still stand at Shido-ji in Kagawa. Menkōfuhai no Tama is now kept in the treasure house of Hōgon-ji on Chikubu Island in Lake Biwa.","Tamatori hime’s legend is preserved by temples associated with her, such as Shidoji in Kagawa Prefecture and Hōgon-ji in Lake Biwa. It is also told in the the famous noh play Ama.","In 669 CE Fujiwara no Kamatari, founder of the Fujiwara clan, died. When his daughter Byakkō, living in China as a consort to Emperor Gaozong of Tang, received news of her father’s death in 669 CE, she was overcome with grief. She sent a ship full of treasures from China to her brother Fujiwara no Fuhito as an offering for their father’s memorial service. Among these were three of China’s most unique treasures: a bronze bell called Kagenkei, a carved stone called Shihinseki, and a flawless jewel called Menkōfuhai no Tama.",,

Inevitably, Ryūgū warashi are forced to bathe or are kicked out by their human parents—after which they return to the sea, and the family loses all of the wealth the Ryūgū warashi brought with it.","The old man was taken to a splendid feast at the dragon palace. He was given a tour through the palace and shown its magical gardens of the seasons. He was presented with as much delicious food as he could eat. But he thought of his wife waiting for him at home, and he asked to be returned to the surface world. The servants of Ryūgū took him back, and since the old couple had no children, they said they would give him a child as thanks for the gift.
When the old man returned home, his wife was waiting for him with a little boy. “Look how amazing this child is!” the old woman sad. “Anything you wish for, he will give it to you!” She asked the boy for food, and in an instant their kitchen stores overflowed with rice. The old man asked for money, and his coin purse was suddenly filled with gold coins. It was like a miracle. All they could ever want was theirs. They wished for land, a large house, expensive clothes, and all of the comforts the wealthy enjoy.
For a while the three of them were a happy family. The old couple grew accustomed to living in their fancy house, wearing fabulous clothing, and eating the best foods. Eventually, they began to notice things that hadn’t bothered them when they were poor. For instance, they noticed how ugly the little child from Ryūgū was. And they noticed how filthy he was. The child did not fit in with their beautiful and clean, new lifestyle.
While couldn’t do anything about the child’s face, they tried to dress him in nicer clothes. He refused to wear them. “At the very least, you must take a bath!” the old couple insisted. But no matter how hard they pressed, the child refused to bathe too. Finally they lost their tempers. They said, “If you won’t even take a bath, you should just go back to Ryūgū!”
Just as they wished, the boy vanished like a wisp of smoke. And when he did, the enormous house, the gold, the fine clothes, and all of the luxuries the child had given the old couple vanished too. They were dirty, cold, and poor; just as they had been before.","Tales about Ryūgū warashi are found across Japan, especially in the Tōhoku region. There are many different versions with details changing from tale to tale. However, the central theme remains the same: those who lose their gratitude after becoming wealthy end up losing everything. Ryūgū warashi share strong parallels with other child-like yōkai like zashiki warashi and hanatare kozō who bring prosperity to a family for as long as they are made to feel welcome.","An impoverished elderly couple lived in a hovel the mountains. Every winter the old man chopped bamboo to make into kadomatsu—New Year’s decorations—to sell door to door. It was hard, but they managed to eke out a living. One year the old man was left with a single kadomatsu that he could not sell. Since it would be useless after New Year’s, he discarded it in a river, calling it a present for Ryūgū.

The young man took pity on the poor creature and released it into the sea. When he arrived, his father was waiting with a fire ready to cook whatever he brought back from the market. The old man was surprised to see his son empty-handed, but after hearing what happened he said that he did the right thing.
That night, the old man and his son sat by the fire, hungry. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. A beautiful young woman entered the hut and said to the young man, “Please, would you take me as your wife?”
The young man refused. “We are so poor that we don’t even have food for New Year’s. We are in no position for me to take a wife.”
The beautiful woman clapped her hands three times, and suddenly three bales of rice appeared outside of the house. It was more than enough rice for the new year. The old man and his son were overjoyed, and they welcomed the young woman into their family.
Soon, the story of the miraculous powers of this wife spread through the land. The local lord summoned the young man to his castle. “Have your wife make me a bolt of fabric finer than anyone has been woven,” he ordered. “If she can not, then I shall take your wife instead.”
When the young man told his wife of the lord’s command, she clapped her hands three times and produced the finest cloth that had ever been woven.
The lord was so pleased with the cloth that he wanted to meet the woman who wove it. He summoned the the old man, the son, and the wife. Upon seeing the young woman, he thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever laid eyes upon. He told them, “I will take this woman as my wife.

There was a nobleman named Shinano no Zenji Yukinaga, who was set to perform shichitoku no mai (“the dance of seven virtues”). However, as he danced before the court, he forgot two of the virtues. As a result, he jokingly became known around the court for his dance of five virtues (gotoku). Sekien connects this wordplay to the yōkai by explaining that gotoku neko are often forgetful.
Cats are often associated with superstitions about house fires. For example, if you let a cat sleep near the fireplace, your house will burn down. It was said that the sparks from the fireplace would ignite the cat’s tail, and then the flaming cat would run around the house igniting everything it touched. Although Sekien does not mention it, the flames on gotoku neko’s tails might be a reference to this superstition.",Gotoku neko was invented by Toriyama Sekien in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro (“An Idle Bag of One Hundred Vessels”). Its name comes from the gotoku–or trivet–that this yōkai wears like a hat. A gotoku is an iron ring with three or four legs used to hold a tea kettle or pot in a fireplace.

Oarfish and other strange, deep sea fish that washed up on shore during the Edo period may have been the inspiration for these yōkai.
Another ryūgū no tsukai appeared off of Kumamoto. Its body was eighteen meters long and its face was 90 centimeters long. It had two horns, and its back was covered in purple scales. It had six fins, a tail like a goldfish’s, and it carried three jewels. This creature explained that it was a messenger from the Dragon Palace and said, “This year there will be severe epidemic of a great evil illness, and the sick will not be saved. Therefore, in order to save many lives, I have come here to give you this message. All who hear my message are sure to be spared from the disease.”","Prophetic mermaids like ryūgū no tsukai inspired popular legends in Japan throughout the 19th century. Originating in Hirado, Nagasaki Prefecture, these stories quickly spread across the country. Minor details changed with each retelling, like an Edo period version of the telephone game, and by the early Meiji era there were dozens of unique examples.","For seven days during April of 1819, a shining creature was seen in the sea off the coast of Tsushima, and people all over the province wondered at it. Eight hundred people from other provinces gathered in one hundred and twenty large boats and fired thirty guns at it all at once, but the thing was not fazed by this. Within seven days after shooting at it, the creature began to speak, and every night it said this: “I am nothing to be afraid of. I have come here from the Dragon Palace for a reason. One day this year, a great evil disease will come, and people will certainly die. Therefore, I ask you to copy my portrait and spread it around the country. Those who see my picture even once will be spared from this evil disease. It will also serve as an amulet for the safety of the land and for long life.” Its body was nine meters long, and its face was about one and a half meters long.",,

Michihiro was pleased when they brought the creature back. But shortly after that, strange things began to happen.
Michihiro offered the rare kitsune’s meat as a present to one of his retainers. After eating it, the retainer became sick. He was immediately struck deaf. Death soon followed. Michihiro had the fur of the kitsune hung out to dry. However, every night a kitsune appeared at the castle and demanded the skin be returned. When Michihiro heard of this he refused. One morning after that, the skin was missing, torn off the drying frame. Then, local fishermen began complaining they could no longer catch herring.
Michihiro was troubled. He believed the dead kitsune placed a curse on his domain. He consulted a temple and had the priest perform one hundred nights of prayers for the kitsune. On the ninety-ninth night, the priest had a vision. A black kitsune appeared to him, explaining it was one of the kitsune who came from Kyōto. It had made a family with a local kitsune and didn’t return with the others. After being killed by Michihiro’s retainers, it was unable to pass on. It remained as a vengeful spirit. It told that priest that if they would build a shrine, it could pass on and serve the area as a guardian spirit.
The priest told Michihiro what the kitsune had told him. Michihiro built an Inari shrine for the black kitsune nearby and enshrined it there. That shrine exists today: the Genko Inari Shrine inside the Kumano Shrine in Matsumae, Hokkaidō.",,"In 1771, the lord of Hokkaidō, Matsumae Michihiro, married a noblewoman from Kyōto.

Normally they are referred to simply as kitsune; although terms like yōko and bake gitsune are helpful to distinguish between the animals and the folklore. Yōko appear essentially identical to ordinary, non-magical foxes. As they grow older and more powerful, they undergo physical changes. For every hundred years of life they acquire an additional tail, up to a maximum of nine.","Kitsune have a complex society which mirrors human society. They are divided into two main categories: yako and zenko. Yako are wild kitsune who have no master. They are not concerned with social advancement, and enjoy playing tricks on humans. Zenko are good kitsune who serve the god Inari. They continue to acquire new social ranks and honors as they age, and they do not harm humans.",,"Kitsune are most famous for their ability to change forms. To learn this skill, young kitsune place an object on their head, face the Big Dipper, and pray. The object is usually a human skull or a bone from a cow or a horse. Other objects may be incorporated into this spell to improve the disguise. For example, to disguise itself as a cook a kitsune might place a piece of kitchenware on its body. To transform into one of their favorite disguises–a beautiful young woman–they use leaves, a lily pad, or duckweed, which transforms into long, elegant hair. As kitsune grow more powerful, they no longer need props to create complex disguises.",Almost every village in Japan has stories about kitsune creating mischief or performing good deeds for the locals.

They try to remain hidden and rarely interact with humans, although signs of their trespassing can be obvious; they often leave unwashed cooking utensils, dishes, and scraps of food behind when they leave. Homeowners usually suspect that neighbors or other humans have broken in to steal their food. But if they check under the floorboards and discover a hole in the ground, it is possible to capture the geya nyūdō with traps, or simply by reaching into the hole and grabbing them.  If captured, they do not put up a fight. Instead, they just smile at their captors.","Geya nyūdō are also called mushō, which means “without flaw.” This is due to the fact that they can live for a very long time without showing any signs of aging.
Thereafter, every time he left the house, Ryōden returned to find leftover cooked rice. Sometimes there were dishes scattered too. When Ryōden told his landlord about this, the landlord was sure it was the work of a kitsune. They gathered some men and searched for a fox hole. Lifting up the tatami mats and prying up the floorboards, they discovered a deep hole. Inside was a little monk, who looked about 80 years old, and was barely 90 centimeters tall.
The landlord dragged the priest out of the hole. It looked at everyone and grinned at them. They questioned the monk, but it just smiled back at them and didn’t seem at all uncomfortable. Several young people gathered, and they decided to kill the strange creature. But then an old man recognized it as a geya nyūdō and remembered a tale from his youth. A creature like this appeared at the house of the lord of Echizen Province. While it was playing in the garden, a samurai shot and killed it. He explained that it was harmless, and there was no reason to kill it. He convinced them to just take it somewhere far away. The townspeople chased it 8 kilometers away from the village and left it.
Six years later, the creature was seen again in an old well at a temple. The well had dried up, and when the went to fill it in, they discovered a tiny person living inside. It was the same geya nyūdō from before. Its appearance had not changed one bit.","Geya nyūdō are well known yōkai in Kuwana, Mie Prefecture, and are also said to be found in Fukui Prefecture.

In May 2003, witnesses claimed that they saw strange eggs in the mountains. When people investigated, they were determined to be hibagon eggs; thus it was discovered that hibagon are oviparous.

She was playing hide and seek with her friends and hid in the third floor bathroom when the air ride sirens went off. She was unable to hear the sirens, so she continued to hide in the stall while her classmates were all evacuated to an air raid shelter.
